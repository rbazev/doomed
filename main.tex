\section{Introduction}

\begin{quotation}
``All populations are doomed to eventual extinction.'' \citet{Lynch_MUTATION_1990}
\end{quotation}

In the absence of back mutations, an asexual individual cannot produce offspring carrying fewer deleterious mutations than itself. Indeed, it is always possible that individual offspring will accrue additional deleterious mutations. 
As a result, the class of individuals with the fewest deleterious mutations may, by chance, disappear irreversibly from the population, a phenomenon known as Muller's Ratchet
\citep{Muller_The_1964, Felsenstein_The_1974, Haigh_The_1978}.  Successive ``clicks'' of the Ratchet will cause the fitness of asexual populations to decline.
Muller's Ratchet has been invoked to explain 
the evolution of sex \citep{Muller_The_1964, Felsenstein_The_1974, gor08},
the accelerated rate of evolution of endosymbiotic bacteria \citep{mor96},
and the degeneration of Y-chromosomes \citep{Charlesworth_Model_1978, gor00b}.  

%\red{\sout{The first formal model of Muller's Ratchet assumed a constant population size}} \citep{Haigh_The_1978}, \red{\sout{and this has been standard ever since}} \citep{Gessler_The_1995,Gordo_On_2000,Pamilo_1987}.
%[R: deal with exceptions later. You have to explain the classic model first and then explain why it's not satisfactory.]. 
%\sout{Given that populations subject to the ratchet are expected to decrease in absolute fitness, this assumption is not expected to hold true in general.} 
\citet{Haigh_The_1978} %\red{\sout{'s model emphasized} 
argued that the Ratchet should click at a rate inversely proportional to the size of the least-loaded class in a population.  If $k$ is the lowest number of deleterious mutations present in an individual in the population, 
the size of the least-loaded class at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium is
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat n_k = N e^{-U/s} \quad ,
  \label{eq:haigh}
\end{equation}
%
%\red{[R: this $n_0$ clashes with our notation later.]}
%\red{\sout{as the most important quantity with respect to the rate of the ratchet,}} 
where $N$ is the size of the population, $U$ is the 
expected number of deleterious mutations
per genome per generation, and $s$ is the deleterious effect of a mutation. 
Haigh suggested that genetic drift causes the actual value of $n_k$ to deviate stochastically from $\hat n_k$.  The smaller the value of $\hat n_k$, the greater the probability that $n_k$ will hit zero, causing the Ratchet to click.  
If $\hat n_k > 1$, then after a click of the Ratchet, the size of the new least-loaded class will go to a new equilibrium, $\hat n_{k+1}$, equal to $\hat n_k$ in Equation \ref{eq:haigh}. 
Haigh concluded that Muller's Ratchet should click faster 
in small populations, 
experiencing a high deleterious mutation rate, 
and mutations with milder deleterious effects (low $s$).
Subsequent work has derived more accurate estimates of the rate of clicking of the Ratchet, both when $\hat n_k > 1$ \citep{Stephan_The_1993, gor00b, Gordo_On_2000, met13} and when $\hat n_k < 1$ \citep{Gessler_The_1995, Rouzine_The_2003, Rouzine_The_2008}.

Beginning with Haigh's foundational study, most research on Muller's Ratchet (including all the papers cited so far) has assumed that population size remains constant as the population accumulates deleterious mutations.  
This assumption is biologically unrealistic---if true, fitness would decline %indefinitely 
\blue{continuously but the population would be immortal}
%without ever causing the population to go extinct 
\citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, mel91}.  Lynch, Gabriel, and colleagues studied more realistic models where the fitness of an individual influences its fertility, and populations experience density-dependent regulation \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, lyn93, Gabriel_MULLER_1993}.  They found that Muller's Ratchet causes population size to decline, which accelerates the Ratchet, which in turn further reduces population size.  This positive feedback results in a ``mutational meltdown'' that drives the population to extinction \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, lyn93, Gabriel_MULLER_1993}.

In one model, \citet{lyn93} considered a population of asexual organisms subject to a carrying capacity of $\widehat N$ individuals.  Each individual produces $R$ offspring.  The number of mutations is Poisson distributed with rate $U$.  The offspring then undergo viability selection with a probability of survival
%
\begin{equation}
  w_k=(1-s)^{k} \quad ,
  \label{eq:fit}
\end{equation}
%
where
$k \geq 0$ is the number of deleterious mutations in the individual offspring,  
and $0 < s < 1$ is the deleterious effect of each mutation. 
If the number of offspring surviving viability selection is $N' > \widehat N$, $N' - \widehat N$ individuals die and $\widehat N$ individuals survive, independently of their fitness; if $N' \leq \widehat N$, all $N'$ individuals survive.  
Reproduction occurs after viability selection and density-dependent regulation.  Assuming that initially all individuals in the population are mutation-free and that $N R > \widehat N$, Muller's Ratchet proceeds in three phases in this model.  
%%%
First, mutations enter the population and accumulate rapidly.  As the distribution of mutation numbers approaches mutation-selection-drift equilibrium mutation accumulation slows down.
%%%
Second, the rate of mutation accumulation settles into a steady rate.  This phase proceeds as in the classic constant population size model of Muller's Ratchet \citep{Haigh_The_1978} and lasts while $N R \, \overline w \gtrsim \widehat N$.
%%%
Third, when mean viability reaches $\overline w = 1/R$ (i.e., when $N R \, \overline w = \widehat N$) the population size begins to decline, triggering mutational meltdown.  During this phase the population is doomed to extinction.


\citet{lyn93} derived some analytical expressions to describe the dynamics of mutation accumulation during the first two phases and the times at which these two phases end.  
However, they did not present any analytical results on the dynamics or duration of the meltdown (third) phase itself.
%%%
Here we model the mutational meltdown phase of Muller's Ratchet using a multi-type branching process.
We derive an analytical approximation for the expected time to extinction under this model
of populations doomed to extinction.  
We find that extinction occurs more quickly in small populations, 
experiencing a high deleterious mutation rate $(u)$, 
and mutations with \emph{more severe} deleterious effects (high $s$).  
Our results differ from predictions on the relationship between the severity of Muller's Ratchet and mutational parameters in populations of constant size.
We also find that mutational meltdown, 
although it does occur in doomed populations,
is not an important determinant of time to extinction. 
Rather, extinction time is approximately inversely proportional to $us$, that is, 
the expected impact of mutations on fitness.

\section{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see \TABLE{example}, for example. 

You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the project menu. To include it in your document, use the \verb|\includegraphics| command as in the code for \FIG{view}. 

For a half-width figure or table with text wrapping around it, use 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.46\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{...}
  \caption{...}\label{...}
\end{wrapfigure}
\end{verbatim}
%
as in \FIG{halfwidth}. For tables:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{wraptable}{l}{.46\textwidth}{
  \begin{tabular}{...}
  ...
  \end{tabular}}
  \caption{...}\label{...}
\end{wraptable}
\end{verbatim}

Be careful with these, though, as they may behave strangely near page boundaries, sectional headings, or in the neighbourhood of lists or too many floats.

Labels for main videos can be added with \verb|\video| e.g.

\video{Ths is a description of a main video.}\label{video:mv1}
\video{Another!}

Labels for video supplements can be added within \texttt{figure} environments, after the \texttt{caption}, using the \verb|\videosupp| command: see \VIDEOSUPP[view]{sv1} for an example.

If you use the following prefixes for your \verb|\label|:
%
\begin{description}
\item[Figures] \texttt{fig:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{fig:view}|
\item[Figure Supplements] \texttt{figsupp:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{figsupp:sf1}|\\
(we'll assume \texttt{figsupp:sf1} is a figure supplement of \texttt{fig:view} in our example)
\item[Figure source data] \texttt{figdata:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{figdata:first}|
\item[Videos] \texttt{video:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{video:mv1}|
\item[Video supplements] \texttt{videosupp:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{videosupp:sv1}|
\item[Tables] \texttt{tab:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{tab:example}|
\item[Equations] \texttt{eq:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{eq:CLT}|
\item[Boxes] \texttt{box:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{box:simple}|
\end{description}
%
you can then use the convenience commands \verb|\FIG{view}|, \verb|\FIGSUPP[view]{sf1}|, \verb|\TABLE{example}|, \verb|\EQ{CLT}|, \verb|\BOX{simple}|, \verb|\FIGDATA[view]{first}|, \verb|\VIDEO{mv1}| and \verb|{\VIDEOSUPP}[view]{sv1}| \emph{without} the label prefixes, to generate cross-references \FIG{view}, \FIGSUPP[view]{sf1},  \TABLE{example}, \EQ{CLT}, \BOX{simple}, \FIGDATA[view]{first}, \VIDEO{mv1} and \VIDEOSUPP[view]{sv1}. Alternatively, use \verb|\autoref| with the full label, e.g.~\autoref{first:app} (although this may not work correctly for figures and tables in the appendices or boxes nor supplements at present).

Really wide figures or tables, that take up the entire page, including the gutter space: use \verb|\begin{fullwidth}...\end{fullwidth}| as in \FIG{fullwidth}. And sometimes you may want to use feature boxes like \BOX{simple}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.46\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{frog}
\caption{A half-columnwidth image using wrapfigure, to be used sparingly. Note that using a wrapfigure before a sectional heading, near other floats or page boundaries is not recommended, as it may cause interesting layout issues. Use the optional argument to wrapfigure to control how many lines of text should be set half-width alongside it.}
\label{fig:halfwidth}
\end{wrapfigure}

Some filler text to sit alongside the half-width figure. \lipsum[1-2]

\begin{figure}
\begin{fullwidth}

\label{fig:fullwidth}
\figsupp{There is no limit on the number of Figure Supplements for any one primary figure. Each figure supplement should be clearly labelled, Figure 1--Figure Supplement 1, Figure 1--Figure Supplement 2, Figure 2--Figure Supplement 1 and so on, and have a short title (and optional legend). Figure Supplements should be referred to in the legend of the associated primary figure, and should also be listed at the end of the article text file.}{\includegraphics[width=5cm]{frog}}
\end{fullwidth}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Citations}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the \verb|\cite| command for an inline citation, like \cite{Aivazian917}, and the \verb|\citep| command for a citation in parentheses \citep{Aivazian917}. The LaTeX template uses a slightly-modified Vancouver bibliography style. If your manuscript is accepted, the eLife production team will re-format the references into the final published form. \emph{It is not necessary to attempt to format the reference list yourself to mirror the final published form.} Please also remember to \textbf{delete the line} \verb|\nocite{*}| in the template just before \verb|\bibliography{...}|; otherwise \emph{all} entries from your .bib file will be listed! 

\begin{featurebox}
\caption{This is an example feature box}
\label{box:simple}
This is a feature box. It floats!
\medskip

\includegraphics[width=5cm]{example-image}
\featurefig{`Figure' and `table' captions in feature boxes should be entered with \texttt{\textbackslash featurefig} and \texttt{\textbackslash featuretable}. They're not really floats.}

\lipsum[1]
\end{featurebox}

\subsection{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CLT}
S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
\end{equation}
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{elife-13214-fig7}
\caption{A text-width example.}
\label{fig:view}
%% If the optional argument in the square brackets is "none", then the caption *will not appear in the main figure at all* and only the full caption will appear under the supplementary figure at the end of the manuscript.
\figsupp[Shorter caption for main text.]{This is a supplementary figure's full caption, which will be used at the end of the manuscript.}{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{frog}}\label{figsupp:sf1}
\figsupp{This is another supplementary figure.}{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{frog}}
\videosupp{This is a description of a video supplement.}\label{videosupp:sv1}
\figdata{This is a description of a data source.}\label{figdata:first}
\figdata{This is another description of a data source.}\label{figdata:second}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Chemistry Niceties}

You can use commands from the \texttt{mhchem} and \texttt{siunitx} packages. For example: \ce{C32H64NO7S}; \SI{5}{\micro\metre}; \SI{30}{\degreeCelsius}; \SI{5e-17}{\Molar}

\subsection{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize} 
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
\item[Word] Definition
\item[Concept] Explanation
\item[Idea] Text

Some filler text, because empty templates look really poorly. \lipsum[1]
