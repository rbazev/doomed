\section{Introduction}

``All populations are doomed to eventual extinction.'' \citet{Lynch_MUTATION_1990}
\end{quotation}

In the absence of back mutations, an asexual individual cannot produce offspring carrying fewer deleterious mutations than itself. Indeed, it is always possible that individual offspring will accrue additional deleterious mutations. 
As a result, the class of individuals with the fewest deleterious mutations may, by chance, disappear irreversibly from the population, a phenomenon known as Muller's Ratchet
\citep{Muller_The_1964, Felsenstein_The_1974, Haigh_The_1978}.  Successive ``clicks'' of the Ratchet will cause the fitness of asexual populations to decline.
Muller's Ratchet has been invoked to explain 
the evolution of sex \citep{Muller_The_1964, Felsenstein_The_1974, gor08},
the accelerated rate of evolution of endosymbiotic bacteria \citep{mor96},
and the degeneration of Y-chromosomes \citep{Charlesworth_Model_1978, gor00b}.  

\citet{Haigh_The_1978} argued that the Ratchet should click at a rate inversely proportional to the size of the least-loaded class in a population.  If $k$ is the lowest number of deleterious mutations present in an individual in the population, 
the size of the least-loaded class at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium is
%
\begin{equation}
  \hat n_k = N e^{-U/s} \quad ,
  \label{eq:haigh}
\end{equation}
%
where $N$ is the size of the population, $U$ is the 
expected number of deleterious mutations
per genome per generation, and $s$ is the deleterious effect of a mutation. 
Haigh suggested that genetic drift causes the actual value of $n_k$ to deviate stochastically from $\hat n_k$.  The smaller the value of $\hat n_k$, the greater the probability that $n_k$ will hit zero, causing the Ratchet to click.  
If $\hat n_k > 1$, then after a click of the Ratchet, the size of the new least-loaded class will go to a new equilibrium, $\hat n_{k+1}$, equal to $\hat n_k$ in \EQ{haigh}. 
Haigh concluded that Muller's Ratchet should click faster 
in small populations, 
experiencing a high deleterious mutation rate, 
and mutations with milder deleterious effects (low $s$).
Subsequent work has derived more accurate estimates of the rate of clicking of the Ratchet, both when $\hat n_k > 1$ \citep{Stephan_The_1993, Gordo_On_2000, gor00b, neh12, met13} and when $\hat n_k < 1$ \citep{Gessler_The_1995, Rouzine_The_2003, Rouzine_The_2008}. 

Beginning with Haigh's foundational study, most research on Muller's Ratchet (including all the papers cited in the previous paragraph) has assumed that the size of a population remains constant as it accumulates deleterious mutations.  
This assumption is biologically unrealistic---if true, fitness would decline continuously but the population would be immortal \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, mel91}.  Lynch, Gabriel, and colleagues studied more realistic models where the fitness of an individual influences its fertility and populations experience density-dependent regulation \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, lyn93, Gabriel_MULLER_1993}.  They found that Muller's Ratchet causes population size to decline, which accelerates the Ratchet, which further reduces population size.  This positive feedback results in a ``mutational meltdown'' that drives the population to extinction \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, lyn93, Gabriel_MULLER_1993}.

In one model, \citet{lyn93} considered a population of asexual organisms subject to a carrying capacity of $\widehat N$ individuals.  Each individual produces $R$ offspring.  The number of mutations is Poisson distributed with rate $U$.  The offspring then undergo viability selection with a probability of survival
%
\begin{equation}
  w_k=(1-s)^{k} \quad ,
  \label{eq:fit}
\end{equation}
%
where
$k \geq 0$ is the number of deleterious mutations in the individual offspring,  
and $0 < s < 1$ is the deleterious effect of each mutation. 
If the number of offspring surviving viability selection is $N' > \widehat N$, $N' - \widehat N$ individuals die and $\widehat N$ individuals survive, independently of their fitness; if $N' \leq \widehat N$, all $N'$ individuals survive.  
Reproduction occurs after viability selection and density-dependent regulation.  Assuming that initially all individuals in the population are mutation-free and that $N R > \widehat N$, Muller's Ratchet proceeds in three phases in this model.  
%%%
First, mutations enter the population and accumulate rapidly.  As the distribution of mutation numbers approaches mutation-selection-drift equilibrium mutation accumulation slows down.
%%%
Second, the rate of mutation accumulation settles into a steady rate.  This phase proceeds as in the classic constant population size model of Muller's Ratchet \citep{Haigh_The_1978} and lasts while $N R \, \overline w \gtrsim \widehat N$.
%%%
Third, when mean viability reaches $\overline w = 1/R$ (i.e., when $N R \, \overline w = \widehat N$) the population size begins to decline, triggering mutational meltdown.  During this phase the population is doomed to extinction.


\citet{lyn93} derived some analytical expressions to describe the dynamics of mutation accumulation during the first two phases and the times at which these two phases end.  
However, they did not present any analytical results on the dynamics or duration of the meltdown (third) phase itself.
%%%
Here we model the mutational meltdown phase of Muller's Ratchet using a multi-type branching process.
We derive an analytical approximation for the expected time to extinction under this model
of populations doomed to extinction.  
We find that extinction occurs more quickly in small populations, 
experiencing a high deleterious mutation rate $(u)$, 
and mutations with \emph{more severe} deleterious effects (high $s$).  
Our results differ from predictions on the relationship between the severity of Muller's Ratchet and mutational parameters in populations of constant size.
We also find that mutational meltdown, 
although it does occur in doomed populations,
is not an important determinant of time to extinction. 
Rather, extinction time is approximately inversely proportional to $us$, that is, 
the expected impact of deleterious mutations on fitness.

\section{Model}




\subsection{Branching process}


A population consists of $N_k$ individuals with $k=0,\, 1,\, 2,\, \ldots$ deleterious mutations.  Below, we refer to individuals with $k$ deleterious mutations as belonging to type $k$.

The size $N = \sum_i N_i$ of the population is allowed to change according to a discrete-time branching process.   
Each generation, an individual of type $k$ reproduces by splitting into two daughters with probability $w_k/2$ and dies with probability $1 - w_k/2$ (\FIG{branching}), where $w_k$ is the fitness of an individual of type $k$ (\EQ{fit}). 
We assume that all mutations have the same deleterious effect $s$ and do not interact epistatically.  
Fitness is \textit{absolute} in our model.

Any offspring may acquire one deleterious mutation with probability $u$. 
Note that $u$ is defined differently from the mutation rate, $U$, in Haigh's model (\EQ{haigh}).
The number of mutant offspring of a surviving individual of any type is binomially distributed  with parameters $2$ and $u$ (\FIG{branching}).

This branching process
yields the probability generating function (p.g.f.) of the number of $k$-type offspring of a $k$-type individual 
%
\begin{equation}
  \varphi_{k}(x)=1-\frac{w_k}{2}\left(1-u^2-2u(1\!-\!u)x-(1\!-\!u)^2x^2\right)
  \label{eq:pgf}
\end{equation}
%
and mean reproduction matrix $M$ with entries 
%
\begin{equation}
  \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
            m_{k,k} & = & w_k (1-u)\\
            m_{k,k+1} & = & w_k u\\
            \end{array} \right.
  \label{eq:m}
\end{equation}
%
where $m_{i,j}$ is the expected number of offspring of type $j$ generated by an individual of type $i$.  All other entries of $M$ are 0.

The mean reproduction matrix for generation $t$ is $M^{t}$, the $t$-th power of $M$. For any $t$, all entries of $M^{t}$ below the diagonal are 0. 
Assuming the fitness function in \EQ{fit}, we can get an explicit form for the entries $m_{i,j}^{(t)}$ of $M^{t}$:
%
\begin{equation}
  m^{(t)}_{k,k+j} = \displaystyle (1-u)^{t-j} u^{j}(1 - s)^{tk\,+\textstyle\frac{j(j-1)}{2}}\prod_{i=1}^{j}\frac{1 - (1 - s)^{t+1-i}}{1 - (1 - s)^{i}}
  \label{eq:mt}
\end{equation}
where $j=0,\,1,\,2,\,\ldots\;$
%,\; a=m_{0,0}=1-u$, and $b=m_{0,1}=u$.

\subsection{Extinction time of individuals of type \emph{k}}


Let $\tau_k$ denote the time of extinction of individuals of type $k$ in a population started from $N_{k}$ ancestors of type $k$ where $N_k$ is a random variable on $\{0,1,2,...\}$ (if $N_k=0$, then $\tau_k=0$).  
There are no individuals of type $i < k$ in the population.
By a standard result from probability theory
%
\begin{equation*}
E[\tau_k]=\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}P(\tau_k>t) \quad .
\end{equation*}

The time of extinction of the entire type-$k$ subpopulation is the time of extinction of the $N_{k}$ independent subpopulations started from the ancestors. The p.g.f.\ of the number of $k$-type individuals in generation $t$ is given by the $t$-fold composition of $\varphi_k$ (\EQ{pgf}) with itself, denoted by $\varphi^{(t)}_k$. We get
%
$$\tau_{k}=\max\{\tau_{k,1},...,\tau_{k,N_{k}}\}$$
%
where $\tau_{k,j}$ is the time of extinction of the subpopulation started from the $j$th individual, $j=1,...,N_k$. If we let $Z_{t}^{(k,j)}$ denote the number of type-$k$ individuals in generation $t$ stemming from the $j$th individual we have the equivalence 
%
\begin{equation*}
\tau_{k,j}\leq n \; \Leftrightarrow \; Z_{n}^{(k,j)}=0
\end{equation*}
%
and get the conditional probability given $N_k$
%
\begin{align*}
%
P(\tau_{k}>t|N_k) & =  1-P(\tau_{k}\leq t|N_k)\\[3pt]
           & =  1-\prod_{j=1}^{N_{k}}P(\tau_{k,j}\leq t)\\[3pt]
           & =  1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{N_{k}}
\end{align*}
%
for $t>0$ which gives 
%
\begin{equation*}
%
E[\tau_{k}] = P(\tau_{k}>0) + E\left[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{N_{k}}\right)\right]
%
%\label{expected1}
\end{equation*}

With $n_k=E[N_k]$, a first-order Taylor approximation gives 
%
\begin{equation}
%
E[\tau_{k}] \approx P(\tau_{k}>0) + \sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{n_{k}}\right)
%
\label{eq:tauk}
\end{equation}
%
Note that for $k=0$ we have $P(\tau_{0}>0)=1$ because there are always individuals present at time $0$. For $k>0$, however, we have $P(\tau_{k}>0)<1$ because, for example, 
the entire population may already be extinct
%type 1 
in generation 1. 

In a similar way, we get the variance as
%
$$\mbox{Var}[\tau_{k}]=E[\tau_{k}(\tau_{k}-1)]+E[\tau_{k}]-E^{2}[\tau_{k}]$$
%
where
%
\begin{align*}
%
E[\tau_{k}(\tau_{k}-1)] & =  2\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}tP(\tau_{k}>t)\\[5pt]
& \approx  2\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}t\left(1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{n_k}\right)
%
\end{align*}

\subsection{Extinction time of the entire population}


By well-known results from the theory of branching processes, the extinction time of the entire population has finite mean only in the {\em subcritical} case, that is, when the mean number of offspring per individual is less than 1. 
%Let $R_k$ be 
The expected number of offspring of type $k$ produced by an individual of type $k$ is $m_{k,k}$ (\EQ{m}).  
%in the next time step so that $$R_k = 2p(1-u)w_k$$
If $m_{k,k}=1$ (the \emph{critical} case), the extinction time $\tau_k$ is finite but has an infinite mean and if $m_{k,k} > 1$ (the {\em supercritical} case), $\tau_k$ itself may assume the value $\infty$.  

\EQ{m} shows that $m_{k,k} < 1$ (the {\em subcritical} case) for individuals of any type $k$ provided all mutations are deleterious $(0<s<1)$ and the mutation rate is nonzero $(u>0)$.  Thus, the expected extinction time of every type $k$ is finite.  
In other words, the population is ``doomed to eventual extinction'' \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990}.  

Start with a fixed number $n_{0}$ of mutation-free individuals and denote by $T_{0}$ the time (generation) of extinction of this class. Conditioned on $T_{0}$, the expected number of individuals in class 1 (those with $k=1$ mutation) is therefore 
%
\begin{equation}
m_{0,1}^{(T_0)}
\label{eq:mT0}
\end{equation}
%
(see \EQ{mt})
which we note is a function of the random variable $T_{0}$. Thus, the expected number of individuals in class 1 at the time of extinction of class 0 is obtained by taking the expected value in \EQ{mT0}. To this end, recall \EQ{mt} and define the function 
%
\begin{equation*}
g_1(\cdot)=m_{0,1}^{(\cdot)}
%\label{g1defined}
\end{equation*}
%
so that 
%
\begin{align*}
%
E\left[m_{0,1}^{(T_{0})}\right] &=  E[g_{1}(T_{0})]\\
&\approx  g_{1}\left(E[T_{0}]\right)
%
\end{align*}
%
where we use a first-order Taylor approximation. To generalize the idea, 
% let $a=2p(1-u)$ and $b=2pu$ as before, and 
we define the 
expected number of descendants of type $j$ from a mutation-free individual after $t$ generations
%
\begin{equation}
g_{j}(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
%
    0              & , & t<j       \\ [4pt]
	m^{(t)}_{0, j} & , & t \geq j
    \end{array}
%
\right. 
\label{eq:gj}
\end{equation}
%
(see \EQ{mt}).


Now let $T_{k}$ be the extinction time for type $k$ and let $t_{k}=E[T_{k}]$. Then we have the approximation
%
\begin{equation}
E\left[m_{0,k+j}^{(T_{k})}\right]\approx g_{k+j}(t_{k})
\label{eq:approx}
\end{equation}
%
the expected number of individuals of type $k+j$ at the extinction of type $k$ for $j=1,2,\ldots$ The expected extinction time of the entire population is
%
\begin{equation}
%
\mathbf{T} = \lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}t_{k} \quad .
%
\label{eq:T}
\end{equation}
%
Now let $X_{T_{k-1}}^{(k)}$ 
be the number of $k$-type individuals at the extinction time of type $k-1$ and let 
%
\begin{equation}
%
x_{k} = E\left[X_{T_{k-1}}^{(k)}\right] \approx n_{0} \, g_{k}(t_{k-1}) \quad .
%
\label{eq:xk}
\end{equation}
%
From \EQ{tauk}, the expected extinction times of consecutive classes can be computed as 
%
\begin{equation}
%
t_{k}\approx t_{k-1}+P(\tau_{k}>0)+\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{x_{k}}\right)
%
\label{eq:tk}
\end{equation}
%
where $n_0$ is the initial population size.  
Note that $t_k$ is the time of the $k$-th click of the Ratchet.
As we noted above, for $k=0$ we have $P(\tau_{0}>0)=1$ 
(\EQ{tauk}).  Thus, if the population is founded by $n_0$ mutation-free individuals, the time to extinction of the mutation-free class is given exactly by
%
\begin{equation}
t_{0} = 1+\sum_{t=1}^{\infty}\left(1-\left(\varphi_{k}^{(t)}(0)\right)^{n_{0}}\right) \quad .
\label{eq:t0}
\end{equation}
%
When $k>0$, \EQ{tk} is an approximation for two reasons.  
First, because $x_k$ is approximate (\EQ{xk}).
Second, because type $k$ may be extinct already at the time $T_{k-1}$ when type $k-1$ goes extinct and, therefore, $P(\tau_{k}>0)<1$.
We can place bounds on $P(\tau_{k}>0)$ by noting that
%
\begin{equation}
\tau_{k} > 0 \; \Leftrightarrow \; X_{T_{k-1}}^{(k)} > 0
\label{eq:tauk2}
\end{equation}
%
and that if $Y$ is any random variable on $\{0, 1, 2, ...\}$ we have
%
\begin{align}
%
E[Y]  & =   E\left[Y|Y>0\right] P(Y>0)\nonumber\\
      & \geq  P(Y>0)
%
\label{eq:exp}
\end{align}
%
By \EQ{xk}, \EQ{tauk2}, and \EQ{exp} we get the bounds 
%
\begin{equation}
%
0 \leq P(\tau_{k} > 0) \leq \min(1,x_{k}) \quad .
\label{eq:Pbounds}
%
\end{equation}
Because extinction of the whole population is irreversible, $P(\tau_{k} > 0)$ is expected to decline for successive classes:
\begin{equation*}
P(\tau_k>0) \leq P(\tau_{k-1}>0) \quad .
\end{equation*}
%
We calculate $\mathbf{T}$ numerically (\EQ{T}) by assuming that $P(\tau_{k} > 0) = 0$ and computing \EQ{tk} until the following criterion is met 
\begin{equation*}
t_k - t_{k-1} < 10^{-6} \quad .
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Large initial population size}


The expected time to extinction of the mutation-free class, $t_0$, is given by \EQ{t0}.
%Motivated by the behavior of $t_0$ as a function of $n_0$, we next turn to investigating the effect of large initial population size on extinction time. Specifically, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of $t_{0}$ as $n_{0}$ approaches infinity. 
Following \citet{Jagers_On_2007}, there exists a sequence $c(n_0)\to c$ as $n_0\to\infty$ such that
%
\begin{equation}
t_0 = -\frac{\ln n_0 + c(n_0)}{\ln m_{0,0}} \quad ,
\label{eq:jagers}
\end{equation}
%
where $m_{0,0} = 1-u <1$ is the expected number of mutation-free offspring per mutation-free individual and $n_0$ is the initial number of mutation-free individuals.  Note that the value of $c$ depends on $u$ (e.g., for $u=0.01$ and 0.02, numerical estimates using \EQ{t0} and \EQ{jagers} yield $c=3.3737$ and $2.7058$, respectively).

\EQ{jagers} shows that $t_0$ grows logarithmically with $n_0$ 
with a slope of $-1/\ln m_{0,0}$.  If $u$ is small, the slope becomes $\approx 1/u$.  Thus, increasing initial population size delays extinction of the mutation-free class more when the mutation rate is low than when it is high.

The value of $t_0$ is not affected by the effects of mutations, $s$ (\EQ{t0} and \EQ{jagers}), because the rate at which individuals ``leave'' the mutation-free class is independent of $s$.  The selection coefficient does, however, affect the size of the new least-loaded class (i.e., individuals with $k=1$ mutation), $x_1$ (\EQ{xk}), and therefore the total time to extinction. 

We now investigate the limiting behavior of $x_1$ as $n_0\to\infty$. By \EQ{xk} and \EQ{jagers} we get 
%
\begin{align}
%
x_{1} &\approx n_0 \, g_{1}(t_0) \nonumber \\[3pt]
%      &= \frac{n_0 \, u}{s} \, (1-u)^{t_0-1} \left(1-(1-s)^{t_0}\right) \nonumber \\[3pt]
      &= \frac{C(n_0) u}{s(1-u)} \left(1-(1-s)^{t_0}\right) \nonumber \\[3pt]
      &\to \frac{C u}{s(1-u)}
%
\label{eq:x1}
\end{align}
%
as $n_0\to\infty$, where $C(n_0) = e^{c(n_0)}$. If $u$ is small and $n_0$ is large, 
\EQ{x1} becomes $x_1 \approx C u / s$.
Interestingly, \EQ{x1} shows that $x_1$ approaches a constant as $n_0$ increases.

\subsection*{Change in population size}


If a population is founded by $n_0$ mutation-free individuals, the expected total population size $t$ generations later is
%
\begin{equation}
E\left[N(t)\right] = n_0 \sum_{j=0}^t{g_{j}(t)}      
\label{eq:N} %\nonumber\\[2pt]
%
%&=n_0 \prod_{j=0}^t\left(1 + u \sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\binom{j-1}{i}(-s)^{i}\right) \\
%&=n_0 \prod_{j=0}^t\left(1-\frac{u \left(1-s-(1-s)^j\right)}{1-s}\right) \\
%
%&\approx n_0 - n_0 u s \binom{t}{2} 
%\label{eq:Napprox}
\end{equation}
%
(see \EQ{gj}).
%Equation \ref{eq:Napprox} is exact for $t \leq 2$ and is a first-order Taylor expansion around $s=0$ for $t > 2$.
%

Initially, $N(0) = n_0$.  Since all individuals have the same fitness, the population size is not expected to change in the following generation: $E\left[N(1)\right] = n_0$.  One generation later, the population size is expected to decline by $E\left[N(2)\right] - E\left[N(1)\right] = - n_0us$.  In subsequent generations, if mutations have small effects, the population size is expected to continue to decline at approximately the same rate
%Using Equation \ref{eq:N}, the expected change in population size from one generation to the next is approximately
%
\begin{equation}
E\left[N(t+1)\right] - E\left[N(t)\right] \approx -n_0 u s t \quad 
\label{eq:deltaN}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}




\subsection{Small population size, high mutation rate, and mutations of large effect accelerate extinction}

In our model, population size, $N$, can increase as well as decrease from generation to generation.  However, all increases are transient and the population will eventually go extinct (\FIG{decay}A).  The expected value of $N$ can be predicted accurately by \EQ{N} (\FIG{decay}B).  However, the dynamics of the expected value of $N$ are not sufficient to predict the time to extinction.  Two populations with different initial population sizes, $n_0$, will be expected to show the same $N/n_0$ at any time (because they will have the same $g_j(t)$, \EQ{N}), but the smaller population is expected to go extinct earlier (\FIG{decay}C and \FIG{decay}D).  \EQ{T} provides good estimates of extinction time, $\mathbf{T}$, over a broad range of initial population sizes, $n_0$ (\FIG{decay}D), and mutational parameters (\FIG{valid}A and \FIG{valid}B).  
(See Appendix 2 for an explanation of why \EQ{T} tends to overestimate the true value of $\mathbf{T}$.)  
Below, we focus on the numerical estimates of $\mathbf{T}$ based on \EQ{T}.

Our model has three parameters---$n_0$, $u$, and $s$---and all of them influence extinction time.  Smaller populations tend to go extinct faster.  \FIG{decay}D shows that $\mathbf{T}$ is approximately proportional to the logarithm of the initial population size, $n_0$.  
%
When $n_0$ is large, $t_0 \propto \ln n_0$ (\EQ{jagers}) and $x_1$ is approximately constant (\EQ{x1}).
Thus, $t_1, t_2, \ldots$ are also expected to approach constant values as $n_0\to\infty$.  Since
$t_0$ grows logarithmically, this result implies that $t_0$ represents an increasing fraction of $\mathbf{T}$ as $n_0$ increases. 
Therefore, we also expect $\mathbf{T}$ to grow logarithmically with $n_0$.
%
At a particular value of $n_0$, however, $t_0$ is not sufficient to explain the variation in total extinction time: 
$t_0$ dominates $\mathbf{T}$ when $u/s$ is low, but not when it is high (\FIG{heat}B).  One reason for this pattern is that $x_1$ increases with $u/s$ (\EQ{x1}; \FIG{heat}C).


Mutations cause extinction in our model, but how do they influence extinction \textit{time}?  
%
One possibility is that $\mathbf{T}$ is determined by the severity of Muller's Ratchet. High mutation rate and mutations of large effect accelerate extinction in doomed populations (\FIG{valid} and \FIG{heat}A).  Mutational parameters act differently on Muller's Ratchet in populations of constant size: at certain mutation rates the severity of the Ratchet is maximal at intermediate mutational effects \citep{Gabriel_MULLER_1993, Gordo_On_2000, gor00b} (\FIG{valid}C).
%
There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy.  
%
First, the Ratchet may operate differently in doomed populations and populations of constant size. 
%
Second, Muller's Ratchet may not determine extinction time in doomed populations.  
%
We consider each of these possibilities in the next two sections.

Note that $\Delta t_k$ is displayed on a log-scale.  Each combination of mutational parameters results in populations having the same expected extinction time $(\mathbf{T} = 223.52)$.  Lines indicate linear regression fits (meltdown rates: $\beta = -3.20, -1.14$ and $-0.32$, respectively).

\label{fig:melt}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Mutational meltdown does not determine extinction time}


Lynch and colleagues have proposed that Muller's Ratchet accelerates in a doomed population as population size declines, driving the population to extinction---a phenomenon they called mutational meltdown \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, lyn93, Gabriel_MULLER_1993}.  Does mutational meltdown determine extinction time? %If so, we would predict that fast extinction would be associated with faster meltdown.}

To answer this question we need a way to measure the rate of mutational meltdown.  Let 
%
\begin{equation}
\Delta t_k = \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
%
    t_0               & , & k = 0       \\ [4pt]
	t_k - t_{k-1}     & , & k > 0
    \end{array}
%
\right. 
\label{eq:deltat}
\end{equation}
%
be the interval between clicks $k-1$ and $k$ of the Ratchet, where $t_k$ denotes the time of the $k$-th click.  
%
In populations of constant size, $\Delta t_k$ is not expected to change with $k$ \citep{Haigh_The_1978, Gordo_On_2000, gor00b}.  
%
In contrast, under mutational meltdown $\Delta t_k$ is expected to decline with $k$.
%
We find that $\Delta t_k$ declines approximately exponentially with $k$ in doomed populations (\FIG{melt}A).  Thus, we use the rate of this decline, $\beta$, to measure the rate of mutational meltdown.

\FIG{melt}A shows that doomed populations can experience strong mutational meltdown.  However, mutational meltdown does not determine extinction time.  Although the three scenarios summarized in \FIG{melt}A have widely different meltdown rates, they have the same expected extinction time, $\mathbf{T} = 223.52$.  The lack of correlation between $\mathbf{T}$ and $\beta$ is clear when we compare \FIG{heat}A and \FIG{melt}B.


\subsection{Extinction time is determined by the rate of fitness decline}


The results so far indicate that Muller's ratchet does not determine extinction time in doomed populations.  So what does?
%
Extinction is, trivially, caused by decline in population size.  In our model the rate of decline in population size is determined by the \textit{product} of mutation rate and effect, $us$ (\EQ{deltaN}).  This makes intuitive sense because the rate of decline in population size is determined by the absolute fitness of individuals and both $u$ and $s$ are inversely related to fitness: 
increasing $s$ reduces the fitness of an individual directly (\EQ{fit}) and increasing $u$ reduces the fitness of an individual's offspring.
%
This explains why time to extinction declines with both $u$ and $s$ (\FIG{heat}A).




\section{Discussion}




Most models of Muller's Ratchet have assumed a constant population size \citep{Haigh_The_1978, Gessler_The_1995, Gordo_On_2000, gor00b, Rouzine_The_2003, met13}.
This assumption is typically justified as resulting from density-dependent regulation of population size.
However, the assumption of constant population size is unrealistic because it actually prevents populations from going extinct \citep{Lynch_MUTATION_1990, mel91}.  
%
In one of the earliest studies to relax the assumption of constant population size, \citet{Lynch_MUTATION_1990} argued that Muller's ratchet generates a vicious cycle:
the Ratchet clicks, 
which causes population size to decline, 
which strengthens drift and reduces the efficiency of natural selection,
which in turn accelerates the Ratchet.  
They called this mechanism mutational meltdown and concluded that it causes populations to go extinct.  This view has become widespread, and mutational meltdown and extinction are assumed to be inextricably linked \citep[e.g.,][]{McFarland_Tug_2014, ban16}.

Our results challenge the view of mutational meltdown introduced by \citet{Lynch_MUTATION_1990}.  Although doomed populations can experience mutational meltdown as measured by the acceleration of the Muller's Ratchet, the rate of mutational meltdown does not determine extinction time (\FIG{melt}).  Rather, extinction time is determined by the expected impact of deleterious mutations on fitness.  We propose

%and that this generates a positive feedback where declines in population size , which causes the Ratchet to click faster, which causes the population size to decline further.  They called this mechanism mutational meltdown and proposed that it causes population extinction.

\begin{itemize}
\item Lynch and Gabriel (1990), using simulations, also find that extinction time is a function of $us$.  
%
\item Log dependence of extinction time on $n_0$, similar to a result in other stochastic models of population dynamics \citep{lan93, Jagers_On_2007}.  Lynch et al. (1993) also infer that for extinction time during the meltdown phase based on simulations.

\item Extinction does not necessarily imply meltdown even if the two are used interchangeably.

\item Relative vs absolute fitness.

\item We must consider variable mutational effects in the future.
%
\item Large increases in $n_0$ cause only relatively small delays in ultimate extinction. 
%
\item Doomed regime can arise either because of mutation accumulation via Muller's ratchet, or because of environmental change.
%
\item The assumption of lack of density-dependent regulation is realistic for populations that have just crossed into the doomed regime.
%
\item The doomed regime is intrinsically interesting because it constitutes the last chance for a population to be rescued by compensatory mutations.  For example, this is relevant for the case of cancer.  And for the evolution of sex where asexuals are thought to be more susceptible to extinction.
%
\item A more realistic regime: we can think of there being 2 regimes for the population depending on its size. 1) When the population is close to carrying capacity relative fitness dominates the dynamics. 2) When the population is well below capacity, absolute fitness dominates (roughly). The first click of the ratchet, therefore, depends on selection coefficient in the first regime but not the second.

\item From the Tug-of-War paper:
``PARP inhibitors, which increase DNA damage in BRCA1/2-positive tumors, may already be curing patients by inducing mutational meltdown.''

\item In their other paper they claim that increasing $s$ has a bigger effect on shrinking a tumor than increasing $u$.  But our model suggests the opposite.
