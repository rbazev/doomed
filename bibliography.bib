	Abstract = {The rarity of exclusively asexual species is often attributed to Muller's Ratchet. This supposes that because asexual populations cannot recreate individuals with fewer mutations than the currently least-loaded line, mutations will accumulate in such isolates. However, because the computer models that corroborate this theory have assumed isolate immortality, it is possible that mutations will accumulate only if there is ``soft'' selection acting on relative, rather than absolute, fitness. Here we, therefore, describe several models in which 200 asexual organisms randomly selected from an infinite population in genetic equilibrium under ``hard'' selection (acting through absolute fitness), were followed for 100 generations. When there were no limits to the fluctuations in population size, the deterministic distribution of mutations per individual was maintained for 100 (as well as for 200) generations. If population growth was limited by a proportional decrease in fertility of the whole isolate, then the isolates tended to become extinct. The rate of extinction was inversely related to maximum isolate size. When resource limitation at maximum population size had an extra deleterious effect on mutants, then isolates shed the mutant classes. Mutations accumulated (ad inifinitum) in immortal isolates whose population numbers were kept constant by proportionately increasing or decreasing each class's size whenever isolate size ≠ 200. Muller's Ratchet, therefore, operates only when mutations affect the outcome of intraspecific contests, but not the organisms' intrinsic ability to survive in the ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {The fixation of new deleterious mutations is analyzed for a randomly mating population of constant size with no environmental or demographic stochasticity. Mildly deleterious mutations are far more important in causing loss of fitness and eventual extinction than are lethal and semilethal mutations in populations with effective sizes, Ne, larger than a few individuals. If all mildly deleterious mutations have the same selection coefficient, s against heterozygotes and 2s against homozygotes, the mean time to extinction, t¯, is asymptotically proportional to e4Nes/Ne for 4Nes {\textgreater} 1. Nearly neutral mutations pose the greatest risk of extinction for stable populations, because the magnitude of selection coefficient that minimizes t¯ is about {\^s} = 0.4/Ne. The influence of variance in selection coefficients among mutations is analyzed assuming a gamma distribution of s, with mean s¯ and variance σs2. The mean time to extinction increases with variance in selection coefficients if s¯ is near {\^s}, but can decrease greatly if s¯ is much larger than {\^s}. For a given coefficient of variation of s, c=σs/s¯, the mean time to extinction is asymptotically proportional to Ne1+1/c2 for 4Nes¯{\textgreater}1. When s is exponentially distributed, (c = 1) t¯ is asymptotically proportional to Ne2. These results in conjunction with data on the rate and magnitude of mildly deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that even moderately large populations, with effective sizes on the order of Ne = 103, may incur a substantial risk of extinction from the fixation of new mutations.},

@article{lan93,
	Abstract = { Stochastic factors affecting the demography of a single population are analyzed to determine the relative risks of extinction from demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and random catastrophes. Relative risks are assessed by comparing asymptotic scaling relationships describing how the average time to extinction, T, increases with the carrying capacity of a population, K, under each stochastic factor alone. Stochastic factors are added to a simple model of exponential growth up to K. A critical parameter affecting the extinction dynamics is \$\$\tilde r,\$\$ the long-run growth rate of a population below K, including stochastic factors. If r̃ is positive, with demographic stochasticity T increases asymptotically as a nearly exponential function of K, and with either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes T increases asymptotically as a power of K. If r̃ is negative, under any stochastic demographic factor, T increases asymptotically with the logarithm of K. Thus, for sufficiently large populations, the risk of extinction from demographic stochasticity is less important than that from either environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes. The relative risks of extinction from environmental stochasticity and random catastrophes depend on the mean and environmental variance of population growth rate, and the magnitude and frequency of catastrophes. Contrary to previous assertions in the literature, a population of modest size subject to environmental stochasticity or random catastrophes can persist for a long time, if r̃ is substantially positive. },

  abstract={Sexual reproduction is both extremely costly and extremely common relative to asexuality, indicating that it must confer profound benefits. This in turn points to major disadvantages of asexual reproduction, which is usually given as an explanation for why almost all asexual lineages are apparently quite short-lived. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that some asexual lineages are actually quite old. Insight into why sex is so common may come from understanding why asexual lineages persist in some places or taxa but not others. Here, we review the distribution of asexual lineage ages estimated from a diverse array of taxa, and we discuss our results in light of the main mutational and environmental hypotheses for sex. Along with strengthening the case for wide variation in asexual lineage age and the existence of many old asexual taxa, we also found that the distribution of asexual lineage age estimates follows a surprisingly regular distribution, to the extent that asexual taxa viewed as “scandalously” ancient merely fall on the high end of this distribution. We interpret this result to mean that similar mechanisms may determine asexual lineage age across eukaryotic taxa. We also derive some qualitative predictions for asexual lineage age under different theories for sex and discuss empirical evidence for these predictions. Ultimately, we were limited in the extent to which we could use these data to make inferences about the maintenance of sex by the absence of both clear theoretical expectations and estimates of key parameters.}

  abstract={Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random passenger mutations—a natural consequence of cancer’s elevated mutation rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We find support for this model in cancer age–incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies. A tumor’s load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by current and future therapies.}

  abstract={Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic alterations. However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.}

  abstract={Background The theory of Muller' Ratchet predicts that small asexual populations are doomed to accumulate ever-increasing deleterious mutation loads as a consequence of the magnified power of genetic drift and mutation that accompanies small population size. Evidence for Muller's Ratchet and knowledge on its underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are lacking for natural populations. Results We characterized mitochondrial genome evolutionary processes in Caenorhabditis briggsae natural isolates to show that numerous lineages experience a high incidence of nonsynonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes and accumulate unusual deleterious noncoding {DNA} stretches with associated heteroplasmic function-disrupting genome deletions. Isolate-specific deletion proportions correlated negatively with nematode fecundity, suggesting that these deletions might negatively affect C. briggsae fitness. However, putative compensatory mutations were also observed that are predicted to reduce heteroplasmy levels of deleterious deletions. Paradoxically, compensatory mutations were observed in one major intraspecific C. briggsae clade where population sizes are estimated to be very small (and selection is predicted to be relatively weak), but not in a second major clade where population size estimates are much larger and selection is expected to be more efficient. Conclusion This study provides evidence that the mitochondrial genomes of animals evolving in nature are susceptible to Muller's Ratchet, suggests that context-dependent compensatory mutations can accumulate in small populations, and predicts that Muller's Ratchet can affect fundamental evolutionary forces such as the rate of mutation.}

  abstract={Muller's ratchet is an important concept in population genetics. It predicts that when mutation rates are high and a significant proportion of mutations are deleterious, a kind of irreversible ratchet mechanism will gradually decrease the mean fitness of small populations of asexual organisms. In contrast, sexual recombination may stop or reverse this mutational ratchet by recombinational repair of genetic damage. Experimental support for Muller's ratchet has previously been obtained in protozoa and in a tripartite {RNA} bacteriophage. We now show clear evidence that Muller's ratchet can operate on a nonsegmented nonrecombining pathogenic {RNA} virus of animals and humans. We did genetic bottleneck passages (plaque-to-plaque transfers) of vesicular somatitis virus {(VSV)} and then quantitated relative fitness of the bottleneck clones by allowing direct replication competition in mixed infections in cell culture. We document variable fitness drops (some severe) following only 20 plaque-to-plaque transfers of {VSV.} In some clones no fitness changes (or only insignificant changes) were observed. Surprisingly, the most regular and severe fitness losses occurred during virus passages on a new host cell type. These results again demonstrate the extreme genetic and biological variability of {RNA} virus populations. Muller's ratchet could have significant implications for variability of disease severity during virus outbreaks, since genetic bottlenecks must often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions and during spread of low-yield {RNA} viruses from one body site to another (as with human immunodeficiency virus). Likewise, the lower-probability generation of increased-fitness clones during repeated genetic bottleneck transfers of {RNA} viruses in nature might also affect disease pathogenesis in infected individuals and in host populations. Whenever genetic bottlenecks of {RNA} viruses occur, enhanced biological differences among viral subpopulations may result.}

Res. 1, 2-9]. The operation of Muller's ratchet on real populations has been experimentally demonstrated only in {RNA} viruses. However, these cases are exceptional in that the mutation rates of the {RNA} viruses are extremely high. We have examined whether Muller's ratchet operates in Salmonella typhimurium, a {DNA-based} organism with a more typical genomic mutation rate. Cells were grown asexually under conditions expected to result in high genetic drift, and the increase in mutational load was determined. S. typhimurium accumulated mutations under these conditions such that after 1700 generations, 1\% of the 444 lineages tested had suffered an obvious loss of fitness, as determined by decreased growth rate. These results suggest that in the absence of sex and with high genetic drift, genetic mechanisms, such as back or compensatory mutations, cannot compensate for the accumulation of deleterious mutations. In addition, we measured the appearance of auxotrophs, which allowed us to calculate an average spontaneous mutation rate of approximately 0.3-1.5 x 10(-9) mutations per base pair per generation. This rate is measured for the largest genetic target studied so far, a collection of about 200 genes.}

  abstract={{WHY} sex exists remains an unsolved problem in biology1–3. If mutations are on the average deleterious, a high mutation rate can account for the evolution of sex4. One form of this mutational hypothesis is Muller's ratchet5,6. If the mutation rate is high, mutation-free individuals become rare and they can be lost by genetic drift in small populations. In asexual populations, as Muller5 noted, the loss is irreversible and the load of deleterious mutations increases in a ratchet-like manner with the successive loss of the least-mutated individuals. Sex can be advantageous because it increases the fitness of sexual populations by re-creating mutation-free individuals from mutated individuals and stops (or slows) Muller's ratchet. Although Muller's ratchet is an appealing hypothesis, it has been investigated and documented experimentally in only one group of organisms—ciliated protozoa2. I initiated a study to examine the role of Muller's ratchet on the evolution of sex in {RNA} viruses and report here a significant decrease in fitness due to Muller's ratchet in 20 lineages of the {RNA} bacteriophage Φ6. These results show that deleterious mutations are generated at a sufficiently high rate to advance Muller's ratchet in an {RNA} virus and that beneficial, backward and compensatory mutations cannot stop the ratchet in the observed range of fitness decrease.}

  abstract={Heritable endobacteria, which are transmitted from one host generation to the next, are subjected to evolutionary forces that are different from those experienced by free-living bacteria. In particular, they suffer consequences of Muller's ratchet, a mechanism that leads to extinction of small asexual populations due to fixation of slightly deleterious mutations combined with the random loss of the most-fit genotypes, which cannot be recreated without recombination. Mycoplasma-related endobacteria {(MRE)} are heritable symbionts of fungi from two ancient lineages, Glomeromycota (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and Mucoromycotina Previous studies revealed that {MRE} maintain unusually diverse populations inside their hosts and may have been associated with fungi already in the early Paleozoic. Here we show that {MRE} are vulnerable to genomic degeneration and propose that they defy Muller's ratchet thanks to retention of recombination and genome plasticity.

This phenomenon is also of potential relevance to sexual species that harbor asexually propagating organelle genomes. A comparative study of the transfer {RNA} genes in animal mitochondrial and nuclear genomes demonstrates that the former accumulate nucleotide substitutions much more rapidly than do the latter, and several lines of evidence are consistent with the idea that the excess substitutions are mildly deleterious. First, the average binding stability between complementary strands in the stems of mitochondrial {tRNAs} is less than half that in nuclear {tRNAs.} Second, most loop sizes in the mitochondrial {tRNAs} have experienced a net reduction in size over evolutionary time, and they are nearly 50 times more variable in the mitochondrial than in the nuclear genome. Third, although nearly 20\% of the nucleotides in nuclear {tRNA} genes (particularly those involved in tertiary interactions) are invariant across all animal taxa and all {tRNA} species, there are no invariant sites in the mitochondrial {tRNAs.} These observations, as well as results from recent laboratory experiments, are consistent with the hypothesis that nonrecombining organelle genomes are subject to gradual loss of fitness due to the cumulative chance fixation of mildly deleterious mutations.}

  abstract={Asexual populations irreversibly accumulate mildly deleterious mutations through the occasional stochastic loss of their least-loaded line, a process known as {“Muller's} Ratchet”. This paper explores the dynamics of this process, and the role of recombination in halting the Ratchet. Simulation studies show that an optimal class comprising no individuals is lost in about 10no generations, implying that adaptedness may deteriorate rather rapidly in geological time. Asexual organisms will persist only if they are very numerous, or if they have very small genomes, or if there is extensive negative interaction among nonallelic mutations. Otherwise, long-term persistence requires that unloaded genomes be continually generated by recombination. An approximate expression for the rate of recombination needed to halt the Ratchet is developed, and shows that substantial recombination is necessary in populations of fewer than about 1010 individuals. A further complication is introduced by mutations in sequences which specify proofreading enzymes. Since these will reduce the fidelity of their own replication, a process of positive feedback leading to an ever-accelerating loss of function is conceivable.}

  abstract={Populations can go extinct when their environments deteriorate, but evolutionary rescue occurs when a shrinking population adapts to the new environmental conditions. The emergence of resistance from a drug sensitive bacterial population under treatment can be regarded as an instance of evolutionary rescue. Understanding evolutionary rescue in a particular context such as drug resistance requires knowledge of how the environment changes and how selection coefficients change as a result. In this study, we propose a model for evolutionary rescue under three different scenarios of environmental change: abrupt change, periodic fluctuation and gradual decay. The model makes use of the notion of reaction norms to describe fitness values that depend on both genotype and environmental state. We find that although drug sensitive bacterial populations may be large, allowing them to generate resistant mutants frequently, a harsh abrupt change due to the drug usually drives them extinct. Evolutionary rescue occurs far more frequently under the milder forms of environmental change we investigated. Rescue is favoured when the absolute fitnesses of individuals remain sufficiently high over the range of environment qualities experienced by the population. The minimum environment quality, which is inversely related to drug dose in the antibiotic context, is thus an important factor. Interestingly, in the periodic fluctuation model, the inter-dose period is less influential in promoting rescue through resistance unless the minimum environment quality is in a particular range. We also investigated fitness trade-offs across environments including the case of a resistant allele not subject to any trade-off (a “superbug”). This fitness trade-off affects the probability of rescue in decaying environments, but surprisingly has only a weak effect in the periodic fluctuation scenario. Finally, we use the model to show how niche construction, whereby organisms are the source of environmental change, produces more complex dynamics.},

  abstract={Evolutionary rescue occurs when a population that is threatened with extinction by an environmental change adapts to the change sufficiently rapidly to survive. Here we extend the mathematical theory of evolutionary rescue. In particular, we model evolutionary rescue to a sudden environmental change when adaptation involves evolution at a single locus. We consider adaptation using either new mutations or alleles from the standing genetic variation that begin rare. We obtain several results: i) the total probability of evolutionary rescue from either new mutation or standing variation; ii) the conditions under which rescue is more likely to involve a new mutation versus an allele from the standing genetic variation; iii) a mathematical description of the U-shaped curve of total population size through time, conditional on rescue; and iv) the time until the average population size begins to rebound as well as the minimal expected population size experienced by a rescued population. Our analysis requires taking into account a subtle population-genetic effect (familiar from the theory of genetic hitchhiking) that involves "oversampling" of those lucky alleles that ultimately sweep to high frequency. Our results are relevant to conservation biology, experimental microbial evolution, and medicine (e.g., the dynamics of antibiotic resistance). },

  abstract={The ubiquity of global change and its impacts on biodiversity poses a clear and urgent challenge for evolutionary biologists. In many cases, environmental change is so widespread and rapid that individuals can neither accommodate to them physiologically nor migrate to a more favourable site. Extinction will ensue unless the population adapts fast enough to counter the rate of decline. According to theory, whether populations can be rescued by evolution depends upon several crucial variables: population size, the supply of genetic variation, and the degree of maladaptation to the new environment. Using techniques in experimental evolution we tested the conditions for evolutionary rescue {(ER).} Hundreds of yeast populations were exposed to normally lethal concentrations of salt in conditions, where the frequency of rescue mutations was estimated and population size was manipulated. In a striking match with theory, we show that {ER} is possible, and that the recovery of the population may occur within 25 generations. We observed a clear threshold in population size for {ER} whereby the ancestral population size must be sufficiently large to counter stochastic extinction and contain resistant individuals. These results demonstrate that rapid evolution is an important component of the response of small populations to environmental change.},

  abstract={The environmental change experienced by many contemporary populations of organisms poses a serious risk to their survival. From the theory of evolutionary rescue, we predict that the combination of sex and genetic diversity should increase the probability of survival by increasing variation and thereby the probability of generating a type that can tolerate the stressful environment. We tested this prediction by comparing experimental populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that differ in sexuality and in the initial amount of genetic diversity. The lines were serially propagated in an environment where the level of stress caused by salt increased over time from fresh water to the limits of marine conditions. In the long term, the combination of high diversity and obligate sexuality was most effective in supporting evolutionary rescue. Most of the adaptation to high-salt environments in the obligate sexual-high diversity lines had occurred by midway through the experiment, indicating that positive genetic correlations of adaptation to lethal stress with adaptation to sublethal stress greatly increased the probability of evolutionary rescue. The evolutionary rescue events observed in this study provide evidence that major shifts in ways of life can arise within short time frames through the action of natural selection in sexual populations.},

  abstract={Many populations are doomed to extinction, but little is known about how evolution contributes to their longevity. We address this by modeling an asexual population consisting of genotypes whose abundances change independently according to a system of continuous branching diffusions. Each genotype is characterized by its initial abundance, growth rate, and reproductive variance. The latter two components determine the genotype's "risk function" which describes its per capita probability of extinction at any time. We derive the probability distribution of extinction times for a polymorphic population, which can be expressed in terms of genotypic risk functions. We use this to explore how spontaneous mutation, abrupt environmental change, or population supplementation and removal affect the time to extinction. Results suggest that evolution based on new mutations does little to alter the time to extinction. Abrupt environmental changes that affect all genotypes can have more substantial impact, but, curiously, a beneficial change does more to extend the lifetime of thriving than threatened populations of the same initial abundance. Our results can be used to design policies that meet specific conservation goals or management strategies that speed the elimination of agricultural pests or human pathogens.},

	Abstract = {Many bacteria live only within animal cells and infect hosts through cytoplasmic inheritance. These endosymbiotic lineages show distinctive population structure, with small population size and effectively no recombination. As a result, endosymbionts are expected to accumulate mildly deleterious mutations. If these constitute a substantial proportion of new mutations, endosymbionts will show (i) faster sequence evolution and (ii) a possible shift in base composition reflecting mutational bias. Analyses of 16S rDNA of five independently derived endosymbiont clades show, in every case, faster evolution in endosymbionts than in free-living relatives. For aphid endosymbionts (genus Buchnera), coding genes exhibit accelerated evolution and unusually low ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions compared to ratios for the same genes for enterics. This concentration of the rate increase in nonsynonymous substitutions is expected under the hypothesis of increased fixation of deleterious mutations. Polypeptides for all Buchnera genes analyzed have accumulated amino acids with codon families rich in A+T, supporting the hypothesis that substitutions are deleterious in terms of polypeptide function. These observations are best explained as the result of Muller's ratchet within small asexual populations, combined with mutational bias. In light of this explanation, two observations reported earlier for Buchnera, the apparent loss of a repair gene and the overproduction of a chaperonin, may reflect compensatory evolution. An alternative hypothesis, involving selection on genomic base composition, is contradicted by the observation that the speedup is concentrated at nonsynonymous sites.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction has been considered as one of the most pressing questions in evolutionary biology. While a pluralistic view of the evolution of sex and recombination has been suggested by some, here we take a simpler view and try to quantify the conditions under which sex can evolve given a set of minimal assumptions. Since real populations are finite and also subject to recurrent deleterious mutations, this minimal model should apply generally to all populations. We show that the maximum advantage of recombination occurs for an intermediate value of the deleterious effect of mutations. Furthermore we show that the conditions under which the biggest advantage of sex is achieved are those that produce the fastest fitness decline in the corresponding asexual population and are therefore the conditions for which Muller's ratchet has the strongest effect. We also show that the selective advantage of a modifier of the recombination rate depends on its strength. The quantification of the range of selective effects that favors recombination then leads us to suggest that, if in stressful environments the effect of deleterious mutations is enhanced, a connection between sex and stress could be expected, as it is found in several species. },

  year={1987},
  abstract={The accumulation of beneficial and harmful mutations in a genome is studied by using analytical methods as well as computer simulation for different modes of reproduction. The modes of reproduction examined are biparental (bisexual, hermaphroditic), uniparental (selfing, automictic, asexual) and mixed (partial selfing, mixture of hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis). It is shown that the rates of accumulation of both beneficial and harmful mutations with weak selection depend on the within-population variance of the number of mutant genes per genome. Analytical formulae for this variance are derived for neutral mutant genes for hermaphroditic, selfing and asexual populations; the neutral variance is largest in a selfing population and smallest in an asexual population. Directional selection reduces the population variance in most cases, whereas recombination partially restores the reduced variance. Therefore, biparental organisms accumulate beneficial mutations at the highest rate and harmful mutations at the lowest rate. Selfing organisms are intermediate between biparental and asexual organisms. Even a limited amount of outcrossing in largely selfing and parthenogenetic organisms markedly affects the accumulation rates. The accumulation of mutations is likely to affect the mean population fitness only in long-term evolution.}

An alternative model is proposed, which is based on the principle of Mullers ratchet; this involves the accumulation of chromosomes bearing deleterious mutant genes in a finite population in the absence of crossing-over. This process would result in the gradual increase, with time, in the number of mutant loci carried in an average Y chromosome, although the frequency of individual deleterious alleles at most loci remains low. It is shown that this creates a selection pressure for differentially increasing the activity of the X chromosome in heterogametic individuals at the expense of that of the Y, leading eventually to a genetically inert Y chromosome and to the evolution of dosage compensation.},

  abstract={Populations can die out in many ways. We investigate one basic form of extinction, stable or intrinsic extinction, caused by individuals on the average not being able to replace themselves through reproduction. The archetypical such population is a subcritical branching process, i.e., a population of independent, asexually reproducing individuals, for which the expected number of progeny per individual is less than one. The main purpose is to uncover a fundamental pattern of nature. Mathematically, this emerges in large systems, in our case subcritical populations, starting from a large number, x, of individuals. First we describe the behavior of the time to extinction T: as x grows to infinity, it behaves like the logarithm of x, divided by r, where r is the absolute value of the Malthusian parameter. We give a more precise description in terms of extreme value distributions. Then we study population size partway (or u-way) to extinction, i.e., at times {uT,} for 0 \{\textless\} u \{\textless\} 1, e.g., u = 1/2 gives halfway to extinction. {(Note} that mathematically this is no stopping time.) If the population starts from x individuals, then for large x, the proper scaling for the population size at time {uT} is x into the power u − 1. Normed by this factor, the population u-way to extinction approaches a process, which involves constants that are determined by life span and reproduction distributions, and a random variable that follows the classical Gumbel distribution in the continuous time case. In the Markov case, where an explicit representation can be deduced, we also find a description of the behavior immediately before extinction.},

  title={Evolution at a High Imposed Mutation Rate: Adaptation Obscures the Load in Phage T7},
  abstract={Evolution at high mutation rates is expected to reduce population fitness deterministically by the accumulation of deleterious mutations. A high enough rate should even cause extinction (lethal mutagenesis), a principle motivating the clinical use of mutagenic drugs to treat viral infections. The impact of a high mutation rate on long-term viral fitness was tested here. A large population of the {DNA} bacteriophage T7 was grown with a mutagen, producing a genomic rate of 4 nonlethal mutations per generation, two to three orders of magnitude above the baseline rate. Fitness—viral growth rate in the mutagenic environment—was predicted to decline substantially; after 200 generations, fitness had increased, rejecting the model. A high mutation load was nonetheless evident from (i) many low- to moderate-frequency mutations in the population (averaging 245 per genome) and (ii) an 80\% drop in average burst size. Twenty-eight mutations reached high frequency and were thus presumably adaptive, clustered mostly in {DNA} metabolism genes, chiefly {DNA} polymerase. Yet blocking {DNA} polymerase evolution failed to yield a fitness decrease after 100 generations. Although mutagenic drugs have caused viral extinction in vitro under some conditions, this study is the first to match theory and fitness evolution at a high mutation rate. Failure of the theory challenges the quantitative basis of lethal mutagenesis and highlights the potential for adaptive evolution at high mutation rates.},

  title={Temporal Variation in Selection Accelerates Mutational Decay by Muller’s Ratchet},
  abstract={Asexual species accumulate deleterious mutations through an irreversible process known as Muller’s ratchet. Attempts to quantify the rate of the ratchet have ignored the role of temporal environmental heterogeneity even though it is common in nature and has the potential to affect overall ratchet rate. Here we examine Muller’s ratchet in the context of conditional neutrality (i.e., mutations that are deleterious in some environmental conditions but neutral in others) as well as more subtle changes in the strength (but not sign) of selection. We find that temporal variation increases the rate of the ratchet (mutation accumulation) and the rate of fitness decline over that of populations experiencing constant selection of equivalent average strength. Temporal autocorrelation magnifies the effects of temporal heterogeneity and can allow the ratchet to operate at large population sizes in which it would be halted under constant selection. Classic studies of Muller’s ratchet show that the rate of fitness decline is maximized when selection is of a low but intermediate strength. This relationship changes quantitatively with all forms of temporal heterogeneity studied and changes qualitatively when there is temporal autocorrelation in selection. In particular, the rate of fitness decline can increase indefinitely with the strength of selection with some forms of temporal heterogeneity. Our finding that temporal autocorrelation in selection dramatically increases ratchet rate and rate of fitness decline may help to explain the paucity of asexual taxa.},

First, we develop analytical models for mutation accumulation that obviate the need for time-consuming computer simulations in certain ranges of the parameter space. When the number of mutations entering the population each generation is fairly high, the number of mutations per individual and the mean time to extinction can be predicted using classical approaches in quantitative genetics. However, when the mutation rate is very low, a fixation-probability approach is quite effective. Second, we show that an intermediate selection coefficient (s) minimizes the time to extinction. The critical value of s can be quite low, and we discuss the evolutionary implications of this, showing that increased sensitivity to mutation and loss of capacity for {DNA} repair can be selectively advantageous in asexual organisms. Finally, we consider the consequences of the mutational meltdown for the extinction of mitochondrial lineages in sexual species.},

  title={The evolutionary advantage of recombination.},
  abstract={The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those authors whose models had finite-population effects found an advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and Muller. It also predicts the "ratchet mechanism" discovered by Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential correctness of the original {Fisher-Muller} argument and the reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly capable of accounting for its origin.},

  title={Theory of Lethal Mutagenesis for Viruses},
  abstract={Mutation is the basis of adaptation. Yet, most mutations are detrimental, and elevating mutation rates will impair a population's fitness in the short term. The latter realization has led to the concept of lethal mutagenesis for curing viral infections, and work with drugs such as ribavirin has supported this perspective. As yet, there is no formal theory of lethal mutagenesis, although reference is commonly made to Eigen's error catastrophe theory. Here, we propose a theory of lethal mutagenesis. With an obvious parallel to the epidemiological threshold for eradication of a disease, a sufficient condition for lethal mutagenesis is that each viral genotype produces, on average, less than one progeny virus that goes on to infect a new cell. The extinction threshold involves an evolutionary component based on the mutation rate, but it also includes an ecological component, so the threshold cannot be calculated from the mutation rate alone. The genetic evolution of a large population undergoing mutagenesis is independent of whether the population is declining or stable, so there is no runaway accumulation of mutations or genetic signature for lethal mutagenesis that distinguishes it from a level of mutagenesis under which the population is maintained. To detect lethal mutagenesis, accurate measurements of the genome-wide mutation rate and the number of progeny per infected cell that go on to infect new cells are needed. We discuss three methods for estimating the former. Estimating the latter is more challenging, but broad limits to this estimate may be feasible.},

	Abstract = {The accumulation of deleterious mutations due to the process known as Muller's ratchet can lead to the degeneration of nonrecombining populations. We present an analytical approximation for the rate at which this process is expected to occur in a haploid population. The approximation is based on a diffusion equation and is valid when N exp(−u/s) ⪢ 1, where N is the population size, u is the rate at which deleterious mutations occur, and s is the effect of each mutation on fitness. Simulation results are presented to show that the approximation estimates the rate of the process better than previous approximations for values of mutation rates and selection coefficients that are compatible with the biological data. Under certain conditions, the ratchet can turn at a biologically significant rate when the deterministic equilibrium number of individuals free of mutations is substantially {\textgreater}100. The relevance of this process for the degeneration of Y or neo-Y chromosomes is discussed.},

  title={The advance of {Muller's} ratchet in a haploid asexual population: approximate solutions based on diffusion theory},
  abstract={Asexual populations experiencing random genetic drift can accumulate an increasing number of deleterious mutations, a process called Muller's ratchet. We present here diffusion approximations for the rate at which Muller's ratchet advances in asexual haploid populations. The most important parameter of this process is n0 = N {e−U/s,} where N is population size, U the genomic mutation rate and s the selection coefficient. In a very large population, n0 is the equilibrium size of the mutation-free class. We examined the case n0 \{\textgreater\} 1 and developed one approximation for intermediate values of N and s and one for large values of N and s. For intermediate values, the expected time at which the ratchet advances increases linearly with n0. For large values, the time increases in a more or less exponential fashion with n0. In addition to n0, s is also an important determinant of the speed of the ratchet. If N and s are intermediate and n0 is fixed, we find that increasing s accelerates the ratchet. In contrast, for a given n0, but large N and s, increasing s slows the ratchet. Except when s is small, results based on our approximations fit well those from computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic model for the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a population of finite size. A click of the ratchet occurs when all individuals with the least number of deleterious mutations are lost irreversibly due to a stochastic fluctuation. In spite of the simplicity of the model, a quantitative understanding of the process remains an open challenge. In contrast to previous works, we here study a Moran model of the ratchet with overlapping generations. Employing an approximation which describes the fittest individuals as one class and the rest as a second class, we obtain closed analytical expressions of the ratchet rate in the rare clicking regime. As a click in this regime is caused by a rare, large fluctuation from a metastable state, we do not resort to a diffusion approximation but apply an approximation scheme which is especially well suited to describe extinction events from metastable states. This method also allows for a derivation of expressions for the quasi-stationary distribution of the fittest class. Additionally, we confirm numerically that the formulation with overlapping generations leads to the same results as the diffusion approximation and the corresponding Wright-Fisher model with non-overlapping generations. },

  title={The constraints of finite size in asexual populations and the rate of the ratchet},
  abstract={An analysis of mutation accumulation in finite, asexual populations shows that by modeling discrete individuals, a necessary condition for mutation–selection balance is often not met. It is found that over a wide parameter range (whenever N e−μ/s \{\textless\} 1, where N is the population size, μ is the genome-wide mutation rate, and s is the realized strength of selection), asexual populations will fail to achieve mutation–selection balance. This is specifically because the steady-state strength of selection on the best individuals is too weak to counter mutation pressure. The discrete nature of individuals means that if the equilibrium level of mutation and selection is such that less than one individual is expected in a class, then equilibration towards this level acts to remove the class. When applied to the classes with the fewest mutations, this drives mutation accumulation. This drive is in addition to the well-known identification of the stochastic loss of the best class as a mechanism for Muller's ratchet. Quantification of this process explains why the distribution of the number of mutations per individual can be markedly hypodispersed compared to the Poisson expectation. The actual distribution, when corrected for stochasticity between the best class and the mean, is akin to a shifted negative binomial. The parameterization of the distribution allows for an approximation for the rate of Muller's ratchet when N e−μ/s \{\textless\} 1. The analysis is extended to the case of variable selection coefficients where incoming mutations assume a distribution of deleterious effects. Under this condition, asexual populations accumulate mutations faster, yet may be able to survive longer, than previously estimated.},

  abstract={We study the population genetics of adaptation in nonequilibrium haploid asexual populations. We find that the accumulation of deleterious mutations, due to the operation of Muller's ratchet, can considerably reduce the rate of fixation of advantageous alleles. Such reduction can be approximated reasonably well by a reduction in the effective population size. In the absence of Muller's ratchet, a beneficial mutation can only become fixed if it creates the best possible genotype; if Muller's ratchet operates, however, mutations initially arising in a nonoptimal genotype can also become fixed in the population, since the loss of the least-loaded class implies that an initially nonoptimal background can become optimal. We show that, while the rate at which adaptive mutations become fixed is reduced, the rate of fixation of deleterious mutations due to the ratchet is not changed by the presence of beneficial mutations as long as the rate of their occurrence is low and the deleterious effects of mutations (sd) are higher than the beneficial effects (sa). When sa \{\textgreater\} sd, the advantage of a beneficial mutation can outweigh the deleterious effects of associated mutations. Under these conditions, a beneficial allele can drag to fixation deleterious mutations initially associated with it at a higher rate than in the absence of advantageous alleles. We propose analytical approximations for the rates of accumulation of deleterious and beneficial mutations. Furthermore, when allowing for the possible occurrence of interference between beneficial alleles, we find that the presence of deleterious mutations of either very weak or very strong effect can marginally increase the rate of accumulation of beneficial mutations over that observed in the absence of such deleterious mutations.},

  abstract={A quantitative study of the operation of Muller's Ratchet for the accumulation of deleterious genes in an asexually reproducing population is made. For a population of size N, in which deleterious mutations occur at rate λ/genome/ generation, and the relative fitness of an individual with k mutants is (1 − s)k, the most important parameter is n0 = Ne−θ, where θ = λs. If n0 is large (⩾25), deleterious mutations will accumulate very slowly, and independently of each other; if n0 is small (\{\textless\}1), the rate of accumulation of deleterious mutations will be greater than a natural population could plausibly bear; an estimate of the speed of the Ratchet for intermediate values of n0 is made. It is pointed out that the frequency distribution for the numbers of individuals carrying k mutants will retain its shape, but will move bodily to the right at the same average speed as the Ratchet. When favourable mutations also occur, the frequency distributions can move right of left; an estimate of the probability that any particular step is right or left is made, and it is shown that, for a given net rate of arrisal of deleterious mutations, the greater the rate of beneficial mutation, the greater the chance that beneficial mutations will accumulate.},

  abstract={The hippocampus and striatum are thought to have different functional roles in learning and memory. It is unknown under what experimental conditions their contributions are dissimilar or converge, and the extent to which they interact over the course of learning. In order to evaluate both the functional contributions of as well as the interactions between the human hippocampus and striatum, the present study used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging {(fMRI)} and variations of a conditional visuomotor associative learning task that either taxed arbitrary associative learning {(Experiment} 1) or stimulus-response learning {(Experiment} 2). In the first experiment, we observed changes in activity in the hippocampus and anterior caudate that reflect differences between the two regions consistent with distinct computational principles. In the second experiment, we observed activity in the putamen that reflected content specific representations during the learning of arbitrary conditional visuomotor associations. In both experiments, the hippocampus and ventral striatum demonstrated dynamic functional coupling during the learning of new arbitrary associations, but not during retrieval of well-learned arbitrary associations using control variants of the tasks that did not preferentially tax one system versus the other. These findings suggest that both the hippocampus and subregions of the dorsal striatum contribute uniquely to the learning of arbitrary associations while the hippocampus and ventral striatum interact over the course of learning. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  title={{Kick-Starting} the Ratchet: The Fate of Mutators in an Asexual Population},
  abstract={Muller's ratchet operates in asexual populations without intergenomic recombination. In this case, deleterious mutations will accumulate and population fitness will decline over time, possibly endangering the survival of the species. Mutator mutations, i.e., mutations that lead to an increased mutation rate, will play a special role for the behavior of the ratchet. First, they are part of the ratchet and can come to dominance through accumulation in the ratchet. Second, the fitness-loss rate of the ratchet is very sensitive to changes in the mutation rate and even a modest increase can easily set the ratchet in motion. In this article we simulate the interplay between fitness loss from Muller's ratchet and the evolution of the mutation rate from the fixation of mutator mutations. As long as the mutation rate is increased in sufficiently small steps, an accelerating ratchet and eventual extinction are inevitable. If this can be countered by antimutators, i.e., mutations that reduce the mutation rate, an equilibrium can be established for the mutation rate at some level that may allow survival. However, the presence of the ratchet amplifies fluctuations in the mutation rate and, even at equilibrium, these fluctuations can lead to dangerous bursts in the ratchet. We investigate the timescales of these processes and discuss the results with reference to the genome degradation of the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola.},

  title={Quantifying the threat of extinction from Muller's ratchet in the diploid Amazon molly {(Poecilia} formosa)},
  abstract={Background The Amazon molly {(Poecilia} formosa) is a small unisexual fish that has been suspected of being threatened by extinction from the stochastic accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations that is caused by Muller's ratchet in non-recombining populations. However, no detailed quantification of the extent of this threat is available. Results Here we quantify genomic decay in this fish by using a simple model of Muller's ratchet with the most realistic parameter combinations available employing the evolution@home global computing system. We also describe simple extensions of the standard model of Muller's ratchet that allow us to deal with selfing diploids, triploids and mitotic recombination. We show that Muller's ratchet creates a threat of extinction for the Amazon molly for many biologically realistic parameter combinations. In most cases, extinction is expected to occur within a time frame that is less than previous estimates of the age of the species, leading to a genomic decay paradox. Conclusion How then does the Amazon molly survive? Several biological processes could individually or in combination solve this genomic decay paradox, including paternal leakage of undamaged {DNA} from sexual sister species, compensatory mutations and many others. More research is needed to quantify the contribution of these potential solutions towards the survival of the Amazon molly and other (ancient) asexual species.},

  title={Mutational Meltdown in Primary Endosymbionts: Selection Limits Muller's Ratchet},
  abstract={Primary bacterial endosymbionts of insects (p-endosymbionts) are thought to be undergoing the process of Muller's ratchet where they accrue slightly deleterious mutations due to genetic drift in small populations with negligible recombination rates. If this process were to go unchecked over time, theory predicts mutational meltdown and eventual extinction. Although genome degradation is common among p-endosymbionts, we do not observe widespread p-endosymbiont extinction, suggesting that Muller's ratchet may be slowed or even stopped over time. For example, selection may act to slow the effects of Muller's ratchet by removing slightly deleterious mutations before they go to fixation thereby causing a decrease in nucleotide substitutions rates in older p-endosymbiont lineages. To determine whether selection is slowing the effects of Muller's ratchet, we determined the age of the Candidatus Riesia/sucking louse assemblage and analyzed the nucleotide substitution rates of several p-endosymbiont lineages that differ in the length of time that they have been associated with their insect hosts. We find that Riesia is the youngest p-endosymbiont known to date, and has been associated with its louse hosts for only 13–25 My. Further, it is the fastest evolving p-endosymbiont with substitution rates of 19–34\% per 50 My. When comparing Riesia to other insect p-endosymbionts, we find that nucleotide substitution rates decrease dramatically as the age of endosymbiosis increases. A decrease in nucleotide substitution rates over time suggests that selection may be limiting the effects of Muller's ratchet by removing individuals with the highest mutational loads and decreasing the rate at which new mutations become fixed. This countering effect of selection could slow the overall rate of endosymbiont extinction.},

  title={Lethal Mutagenesis of Bacteria},
  abstract={Lethal mutagenesis, the killing of a microbial pathogen with a chemical mutagen, is a potential broad-spectrum antiviral treatment. It operates by raising the genomic mutation rate to the point that the deleterious load causes the population to decline. Its use has been limited to {RNA} viruses because of their high intrinsic mutation rates. Microbes with {DNA} genomes, which include many viruses and bacteria, have not been considered for this type of treatment because their low intrinsic mutation rates seem difficult to elevate enough to cause extinction. Surprisingly, models of lethal mutagenesis indicate that bacteria may be candidates for lethal mutagenesis. In contrast to viruses, bacteria reproduce by binary fission, and this property ensures their extinction if subjected to a mutation rate \{\textgreater\}0.69 deleterious mutations per generation. The extinction threshold is further lowered when bacteria die from environmental causes, such as washout or host clearance. In practice, mutagenesis can require many generations before extinction is achieved, allowing the bacterial population to grow to large absolute numbers before the load of deleterious mutations causes the decline. Therefore, if effective treatment requires rapid population decline, mutation rates ≫0.69 may be necessary to achieve treatment success. Implications for the treatment of bacteria with mutagens, for the evolution of mutator strains in bacterial populations, and also for the evolution of mutation rate in cancer are discussed.},

  abstract={In large asexual populations, multiple beneficial mutations arise in the population, compete, interfere with each other, and accumulate on the same genome, before any of them fix. The resulting dynamics, although studied by many authors, is still not fully understood, fundamentally because the effects of fluctuations due to the small numbers of the fittest individuals are large even in enormous populations. In this paper, branching processes and various asymptotic methods for analyzing the stochastic dynamics are further developed and used to obtain information on fluctuations, time dependence, and the distributions of sizes of subpopulations, jumps in the mean fitness, and other properties. The focus is on the behavior of a broad class of models: those with a distribution of selective advantages of available beneficial mutations that falls off more rapidly than exponentially. For such distributions, many aspects of the dynamics are universal—quantitatively so for extremely large populations. On the most important time scale that controls coalescent properties and fluctuations of the speed, the dynamics is reduced to a simple stochastic model that couples the peak and the high-fitness 'nose' of the fitness distribution. Extensions to other models and distributions of available mutations are discussed briefly.},

  title={The solitary wave of asexual evolution},
  abstract={Using a previously undescribed approach, we develop an analytic model that predicts whether an asexual population accumulates advantageous or deleterious mutations over time and the rate at which either process occurs. The model considers a large number of linked identical loci, or nucleotide sites; assumes that the selection coefficient per site is much less than the mutation rate per genome; and includes back and compensating mutations. Using analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy of our results over almost the entire range of population sizes. Two limiting cases of our results, when either deleterious or advantageous mutations can be neglected, correspond to the {Fisher–Muller} effect and Muller's ratchet, respectively. By comparing predictions of our model (no recombination) to those of simple single-locus models (strong recombination), we show that the accumulation of advantageous mutations is slowed by linkage over a broad, finite range of population size. This supports the view of Fisher and Muller, who argued in the 1930s that progressive evolution of organisms is slowed because loci at which beneficial mutations can occur are often linked together on the same chromosome. These results follow from our main finding, that distribution of sequences over the mutation number evolves as a traveling wave whose speed and width depend on population size and other parameters. The model explains a logarithmic dependence of steady-state fitness on the population size reported recently for an {RNA} virus.},

We find that Muller's ratchet can come to a halt in small populations as a consequence of a finite genome size only, in the complete absence of backward or compensatory mutations, epistasis, or recombination. The origin of this effect lies in the fact that the number of loci at which mutations can create considerable damage decreases with every turn of the ratchet, while the total number of mutations per genome and generation remains constant. Whether the ratchet will come to a halt eventually depends on the ratio of the per-locus deleterious mutation rate \$u\$ and the selection strength \$s\$. For sufficiently small \$u/s\$, the ratchet halts after only a few clicks. We discuss the implications of our results for bacterial and virus evolution.},

The most famous of these is the twofold cost of males, which can greatly reduce the fecundity of a sexual population, compared to a population of asexual females. Over the past century, multiple hypotheses, along with experimental evidence to support these, have been put forward to explain widespread costly sex. In this review, we outline some of the most prominent theories, along with the experimental and observational evidence supporting these. Historically, there have been 4 classes of theories: the ability of sex to fix multiple novel advantageous mutants {(Fisher–Muller} hypothesis); sex as a mechanism to stop the build-up of deleterious mutations in finite populations {(Muller's} ratchet); recombination creating novel genotypes that can resist infection by parasites {(Red} Queen hypothesis); and the ability of sex to purge bad genomes if deleterious mutations act synergistically (mutational deterministic hypothesis). Current theoretical and experimental evidence seems to favor the hypothesis that sex breaks down selection interference between new mutants, or it acts as a mechanism to shuffle genotypes in order to repel parasitic invasion. However, there is still a need to collect more data from natural populations and experimental studies, which can be used to test different hypotheses.},

  abstract={The rarity of exclusively asexual species is often attributed to Muller's Ratchet. This supposes that because asexual populations cannot recreate individuals with fewer mutations than the currently least-loaded line, mutations will accumulate in such isolates. However, because the computer models that corroborate this theory have assumed isolate immortality, it is possible that mutations will accumulate only if there is “soft” selection acting on relative, rather than absolute, fitness. Here we, therefore, describe several models in which 200 asexual organisms randomly selected from an infinite population in genetic equilibrium under “hard” selection (acting through absolute fitness), were followed for 100 generations. When there were no limits to the fluctuations in population size, the deterministic distribution of mutations per individual was maintained for 100 (as well as for 200) generations. If population growth was limited by a proportional decrease in fertility of the whole isolate, then the isolates tended to become extinct. The rate of extinction was inversely related to maximum isolate size. When resource limitation at maximum population size had an extra deleterious effect on mutants, then isolates shed the mutant classes. Mutations accumulated (ad inifinitum) in immortal isolates whose population numbers were kept constant by proportionately increasing or decreasing each class's size whenever isolate size ≠ 200. Muller's Ratchet, therefore, operates only when mutations affect the outcome of intraspecific contests, but not the organisms' intrinsic ability to survive in the ecosystem.},

  abstract={We consider an asexual biological population of constant size N evolving in discrete time under the influence of selection and mutation. Beneficial mutations appear at rate U and their selective effects s are drawn from a distribution g(s). After introducing the required models and concepts of mathematical population genetics, we review different approaches to computing the speed of logarithmic fitness increase as a function of N, U and g(s). We present an exact solution of the infinite population size limit and provide an estimate of the population size beyond which it is valid. We then discuss approximate approaches to the finite population problem, distinguishing between the case of a single selection coefficient, g(s)=δ(s−s b ), and a continuous distribution of selection coefficients. Analytic estimates for the speed are compared to numerical simulations up to population sizes of order 10300.},

  abstract={Rapid evolution of asexual populations, such as that of cancer cells or of microorganisms developing drug resistance, can include the simultaneous spread of distinct beneficial mutations. We demonstrate that evolution in such cases is driven by the fitness effects and appearance times of only a small minority of favorable mutations. The complexity of the mutation-selection process is thereby greatly reduced, and much of the evolutionary dynamics can be encapsulated in two parameters—an effective selection coefficient and effective rate of beneficial mutations. We confirm this theoretical finding and estimate the effective parameters for evolving populations of fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli. The effective parameters constitute a simple description and provide a natural standard for comparing adaptation between species and across environments.},

  abstract={The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (the {DFE)} is a key parameter in determining the course of evolution. This fact has motivated extensive efforts to measure the {DFE} or to predict it from first principles. However, just as the {DFE} determines the course of evolution, the evolutionary process itself constrains the {DFE.} Here, we analyze a simple model of genome evolution in a constant environment in which natural selection drives the population toward a dynamic steady state where beneficial and deleterious substitutions balance. The distribution of fitness effects at this steady state is stable under further evolution, and provides a natural null expectation for the {DFE} in a population that has evolved in a constant environment for a long time. We calculate how the shape of the evolutionarily stable {DFE} depends on the underlying population genetic parameters. We show that, in the absence of epistasis, the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations of a given fitness effect obeys a simple relationship independent of population genetic details. Finally, we analyze how the stable {DFE} changes in the presence of a simple form of diminishing returns epistasis.},

In the neutral regime, where mutations have zero effect on fitness, we derive a recursion equation for the probability distribution of the minimum number of mutations carried by individuals in the least-loaded class, and obtain an explicit condition for the halting of the ratchet. Next, we consider the case of deleterious mutations, and show that weak selection can actually accelerate the ratchet beyond that achieved for the neutral regime. This effect is transitory, however, as our results suggest that even weak purifying selection will eventually lead to the complete cessation of the ratchet. These results may have important implications for problems in biology and the medical sciences.},

  title={Multiple time-scales and the developmental dynamics of social systems},
  abstract={To build a theory of social complexity, we need to understand how aggregate social properties arise from individual interaction rules. Here, I review a body of work on the developmental dynamics of pigtailed macaque social organization and conflict management that provides insight into the mechanistic causes of multi-scale social systems. In this model system coarse-grained, statistical representations of collective dynamics are more predictive of the future state of the system than the constantly in-flux behavioural patterns at the individual level. The data suggest that individuals can perceive and use these representations for strategical decision-making. As an interaction history accumulates the coarse-grained representations consolidate. This constrains individual behaviour and provides the foundations for new levels of organization. The time-scales on which these representations change impact whether the consolidating higher-levels can be modified by individuals and collectively. The time-scales appear to be a function of the ‘coarseness’ of the representations and the character of the collective dynamics over which they are averages. The data suggest that an advantage of multiple timescales is that they allow social systems to balance tradeoffs between predictability and adaptability. I briefly discuss the implications of these findings for cognition, social niche construction and the evolution of new levels of organization in biological systems.},

  title={Distribution of the Fittest Individuals and the Rate of Muller's Ratchet in a Model with Overlapping Generations},
  abstract={Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic model for the accumulation of deleterious mutations in a population of finite size. A click of the ratchet occurs when all individuals with the least number of deleterious mutations are lost irreversibly due to a stochastic fluctuation. In spite of the simplicity of the model, a quantitative understanding of the process remains an open challenge. In contrast to previous works, we here study a Moran model of the ratchet with overlapping generations. Employing an approximation which describes the fittest individuals as one class and the rest as a second class, we obtain closed analytical expressions of the ratchet rate in the rare clicking regime. As a click in this regime is caused by a rare, large fluctuation from a metastable state, we do not resort to a diffusion approximation but apply an approximation scheme which is especially well suited to describe extinction events from metastable states. This method also allows for a derivation of expressions for the quasi-stationary distribution of the fittest class. Additionally, we confirm numerically that the formulation with overlapping generations leads to the same results as the diffusion approximation and the corresponding {Wright-Fisher} model with non-overlapping generations.},

  abstract={The vast majority of mutations are deleterious, and are eliminated by purifying selection. Yet in finite asexual populations, purifying selection cannot completely prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to Muller's ratchet: once lost by stochastic drift, the most-fit class of genotypes is lost forever. If deleterious mutations are weakly selected, Muller's ratchet turns into a mutational "meltdown" leading to a rapid degradation of population fitness. Evidently, the long term stability of an asexual population requires an influx of beneficial mutations that continuously compensate for the accumulation of the weakly deleterious ones. Here we propose that the stable evolutionary state of a population in a static environment is a dynamic mutation-selection balance, where accumulation of deleterious mutations is on average offset by the influx of beneficial mutations. We argue that this state exists for any population size N and mutation rate {\$U\$.} Assuming that beneficial and deleterious mutations have the same fitness effect s, we calculate the fraction of beneficial mutations, \{\textbackslash\}epsilon, that maintains the balanced state. We find that a surprisingly low \{\textbackslash\}epsilon suffices to maintain stability, even in small populations in the face of high mutation rates and weak selection. This may explain the maintenance of mitochondria and other asexual genomes, and has implications for the expected statistics of genetic diversity in these populations.},

Using experimental evolution with bacteriophage, we show here that the converse is also true. In populations small enough such that drift overwhelms selection and causes fitness to decrease, fitness declines down to a plateau. We demonstrate theoretically that both of these phenomena must be due either to changes in the ratio of beneficial to deleterious mutations, the size of mutational effects, or both. We use mutation accumulation experiments and molecular data from experimental evolution to show that the most significant change in mutational effects is a drastic increase in the rate of beneficial mutation as fitness decreases. In contrast, the size of mutational effects changes little even as organismal fitness changes over several orders of magnitude. These findings have significant implications for the dynamics of adaptation.},

  title={Lethal mutagenesis and evolutionary epidemiology},
  abstract={The lethal mutagenesis hypothesis states that within-host populations of pathogens can be driven to extinction when the load of deleterious mutations is artificially increased with a mutagen, and becomes too high for the population to be maintained. Although chemical mutagens have been shown to lead to important reductions in viral titres for a wide variety of {RNA} viruses, the theoretical underpinnings of this process are still not clearly established. A few recent models sought to describe lethal mutagenesis but they often relied on restrictive assumptions. We extend this earlier work in two novel directions. First, we derive the dynamics of the genetic load in a multivariate Gaussian fitness landscape akin to classical quantitative genetics models. This fitness landscape yields a continuous distribution of mutation effects on fitness, ranging from deleterious to beneficial (i.e. compensatory) mutations. We also include an additional class of lethal mutations. Second, we couple this evolutionary model with an epidemiological model accounting for the within-host dynamics of the pathogen. We derive the epidemiological and evolutionary equilibrium of the system. At this equilibrium, the density of the pathogen is expected to decrease linearly with the genomic mutation rate U. We also provide a simple expression for the critical mutation rate leading to extinction. Stochastic simulations show that these predictions are accurate for a broad range of parameter values. As they depend on a small set of measurable epidemiological and evolutionary parameters, we used available information on several viruses to make quantitative and testable predictions on critical mutation rates. In the light of this model, we discuss the feasibility of lethal mutagenesis as an efficient therapeutic strategy.},

  title={Does Mutational Robustness Inhibit Extinction by Lethal Mutagenesis in Viral Populations?},
  abstract={Lethal mutagenesis is a promising new antiviral therapy that kills a virus by raising its mutation rate. One potential shortcoming of lethal mutagenesis is that viruses may resist the treatment by evolving genomes with increased robustness to mutations. Here, we investigate to what extent mutational robustness can inhibit extinction by lethal mutagenesis in viruses, using both simple toy models and more biophysically realistic models based on {RNA} secondary-structure folding. We show that although the evolution of greater robustness may be promoted by increasing the mutation rate of a viral population, such evolution is unlikely to greatly increase the mutation rate required for certain extinction. Using an analytic multi-type branching process model, we investigate whether the evolution of robustness can be relevant on the time scales on which extinction takes place. We find that the evolution of robustness matters only when initial viral population sizes are small and deleterious mutation rates are only slightly above the level at which extinction can occur. The stochastic calculations are in good agreement with simulations of self-replicating {RNA} sequences that have to fold into a specific secondary structure to reproduce. We conclude that the evolution of mutational robustness is in most cases unlikely to prevent the extinction of viruses by lethal mutagenesis.},

  title={Influence of Mutagenesis and Viral Load on the Sustained {Low-Level} Replication of an {RNA} Virus},
  abstract={Lethal mutagenesis is an antiviral strategy that aims to extinguish viruses as a consequence of enhanced mutation rates during virus replication. The molecular mechanisms that underlie virus extinction by mutagenic nucleoside analogues are not well understood. When mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors are administered sequentially or in combination, interconnected and often conflicting selective constraints can influence the fate of the virus either towards survival through selection of mutagen-escape or inhibitor-escape mutants or towards extinction. Here we report a study involving the mutagenesis of foot-and-mouth disease virus {(FMDV)} by the nucleoside analogue ribavirin {(R)} and the effect of R-mediated mutagenesis on the selection of {FMDV} mutants resistant to the inhibitor of {RNA} replication, guanidine hydrochloride {(GU).} The results show that under comparable (and low) viral load, an inhibitory activity by {GU} could not substitute for an equivalent inhibitory activity by R in driving {FMDV} to extinction. Both the prior history of R mutagenesis and the viral population size influenced the selection of {GU-escape} mutants. A sufficiently low viral load allowed continued viral replication without selection of inhibitor-escape mutants, irrespective of the history of mutagenesis. These observations imply that reductions of viral load as a result of a mutagenic treatment may provide an opportunity either for immune-mediated clearing of a virus or for an alternative antiviral intervention, even if extinction is not initially achieved.},

Traveling-wave theory is a semi-deterministic description of an evolving population, where the bulk of the population is modeled using deterministic equations, but the class of the highest-fitness genotypes, whose evolution over time determines loss or gain of fitness in the population, is given proper stochastic treatment. We derive improved methods to model the highest-fitness class (the stochastic edge) for both Muller's ratchet and adaptive evolution, and calculate analytic correction terms that compensate for inaccuracies which arise when treating discrete fitness classes as a continuum. We show that traveling-wave theory makes excellent predictions for the rate of mutation accumulation in the case of Muller's ratchet, and makes good predictions for the speed of adaptation in a very broad parameter range. We predict the adaptation rate to grow logarithmically in the population size until the population size is extremely large.},

  abstract={Abstract The evolutionary force of recombination is lacking in asexually reproducing populations. As a consequence, the population can suffer an irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet. We formulate discrete and continuous time versions of Muller's ratchet. Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of a dynamical system which arises in the limit of large populations, we identify the parameter γ = {Nλ/(Ns} {\textperiodcentered} {log(Nλ))} as most important for the speed of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Here N is population size, s is the selection coefficient and λ is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the parameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations accumulate according to a power law in Nλ with exponent γ if γ ≥ 0.5. For γ \{\textless\} 0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion approximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of the ratchet. Our approximations shed new light on analyses of Stephan et al. (1993) and Gordo and Charlesworth (2000). The heuristics leading to the approximations are supported by simulations. Introduction Muller's ratchet is a mechanism that has been suggested as an explanation for the evolution of sex [13]. The idea is simple; in an asexually reproducing population chromosomes are passed down as indivisible blocks and so the number of deleterious mutations accumulated along any ancestral line in the population can only increase.},

  abstract={Background The accumulation of deleterious mutations of a population directly contributes to the fate as to how long the population would exist, a process often described as Muller's ratchet with the absorbing phenomenon. The key to understand this absorbing phenomenon is to characterize the decaying time of the fittest class of the population. Adaptive landscape introduced by Wright, a re-emerging powerful concept in systems biology, is used as a tool to describe biological processes. To our knowledge, the dynamical behaviors for Muller's ratchet over the full parameter regimes are not studied from the point of the adaptive landscape. And the characterization of the absorbing phenomenon is not yet quantitatively obtained without extraneous assumptions as well. Methods We describe how Muller's ratchet can be mapped to the classical {Wright-Fisher} process in both discrete and continuous manners. Furthermore, we construct the adaptive landscape for the system analytically from the general diffusion equation. The constructed adaptive landscape is independent of the existence and normalization of the stationary distribution. We derive the formula of the single click time in finite and infinite potential barrier for all parameters regimes by mean first passage time. Results We describe the dynamical behavior of the population exposed to Muller's ratchet in all parameters regimes by adaptive landscape. The adaptive landscape has rich structures such as finite and infinite potential, real and imaginary fixed points. We give the formula about the single click time with finite and infinite potential. And we find the single click time increases with selection rates and population size increasing, decreases with mutation rates increasing. These results provide a new understanding of infinite potential. We analytically demonstrate the adaptive and unadaptive states for the whole parameters regimes. Interesting issues about the parameters regions with the imaginary fixed points is demonstrated. Most importantly, we find that the absorbing phenomenon is characterized by the adaptive landscape and the single click time without any extraneous assumptions. These results suggest a graphical and quantitative framework to study the absorbing phenomenon.},

  title={Fluctuations of Fitness Distributions and the Rate of Muller’s Ratchet},
  abstract={The accumulation of deleterious mutations is driven by rare fluctuations that lead to the loss of all mutation free individuals, a process known as Muller’s ratchet. Even though Muller’s ratchet is a paradigmatic process in population genetics, a quantitative understanding of its rate is still lacking. The difficulty lies in the nontrivial nature of fluctuations in the fitness distribution, which control the rate of extinction of the fittest genotype. We address this problem using the simple but classic model of mutation selection balance with deleterious mutations all having the same effect on fitness. We show analytically how fluctuations among the fittest individuals propagate to individuals of lower fitness and have dramatically amplified effects on the bulk of the population at a later time. If a reduction in the size of the fittest class reduces the mean fitness only after a delay, selection opposing this reduction is also delayed. This delayed restoring force speeds up Muller’s ratchet. We show how the delayed response can be accounted for using a path-integral formulation of the stochastic dynamics and provide an expression for the rate of the ratchet that is accurate across a broad range of parameters.},

  title={How often does the ratchet click? Facts, heuristics, asymptotics},
  abstract={The evolutionary force of recombination is lacking in asexually reproducing populations. As a consequence, the population can suffer an irreversible accumulation of deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet. We formulate discrete and continuous time versions of Muller's ratchet. Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of a dynamical system which arises in the limit of large populations, we identify the parameter gamma = {N*lambda/(Ns*log(N*lambda))} as most important for the speed of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Here N is population size, s is the selection coefficient and lambda is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the parameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations accumulate according to a power law in N*lambda with exponent gamma if gamma\{\textgreater\}0.5. For gamma\{\textless\}0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion approximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of the ratchet. Our approximations shed new light on analyses of Stephan et al. (1993) and Gordo \& Charlesworth (2000). The heuristics leading to the approximations are supported by simulations.},

  title={Natural selection can favor the evolution of ratchet robustness over evolution of mutational robustness},
  abstract={The vast majority of fitness-affecting mutations are deleterious. How natural populations evolve to cope is a question of fundamental interest. Previous studies have reported the evolution of mutational robustness, that is, natural selection favoring mutations that reduce effects of deleterious mutations elsewhere in the genome. Here, we demonstrate that when mutational robustness increases, finite, asexual populations' ability to purge recurrent deleterious mutations declines. Consequently, higher mutational robustness leads to higher risk of extinction by Muller's ratchet. We therefore hypothesize that in the long run, natural populations may instead evolve robustness against Muller's ratchet by increasing sensitivity to deleterious mutations, despite the short-term fitness consequences. We call this phenomenon "ratchet robustness". Using individual-based simulations, we first confirm that ratchet robustness is inversely correlated with mutational robustness on fitness landscapes without epistasis. Next, we demonstrate that negative epistasis increases ratchet robustness, precisely because on fitness landscapes with negative epistasis sensitivity to deleterious mutations increases as mutations accumulate. We also show that on a fitness landscape with adjacent fitness peaks exhibiting exclusively positive and negative epistasis, the populations will converge on the latter. On the other hand, introducing even a vanishingly small region of positive epistasis on a single-peaked fitness landscape that otherwise exhibits negative epistasis is enough to entirely ablate ratchet robustness, exposing the population to Muller's ratchet. We conclude that while regions of the fitness landscape with higher mutational robustness could be favored in the short term, purely because of temporary fitness advantage, in the long run mutational robustness may render a population vulnerable to extinction. Some empirical support exists for this prediction.},

  title={Mutation load and the survival of small populations},
  abstract={Previous attempts to model the joint action of selection and mutation in finite populations have treated population size as being independent of the mutation load. However, the accumulation of deleterious mutations is expected to cause a gradual reduction in population size. Consequently, in small populations random genetic drift will progressively overpower selection making it easier to fix future mutations. This synergistic interaction, which we refer to as a mutational melt-down, ultimately leads to population extinction. For many conditions, the coefficient of variation of extinction time is less than 0.1, and for species that reproduce by binary fission, the expected extinction time is quite insensitive to population carrying capacity. These results are consistent with observations that many cultures of ciliated protozoans and vertebrate fibroblasts have characteristic extinction times. The model also predicts that clonal lineages are unlikely to survive more than 104 to 105 generations, which is consistent with existing data on parthenogenetic animals. Contrary to the usual view that Muller's ratchet does more damage when selection is weak, we show that the mean extinction time declines as mutations become more deleterious. Although very small sexual populations, such as self-fertilized lines, are subject to mutational meltdowns, recombination effectively eliminates the process when the effective population size exceeds a dozen or so. The concept of the effective mutation load is developed, and several procedures for estimating it are described. It is shown that this load can be reduced substantially when mutational effects are highly variable.},

	Abstract = {Loss of fitness due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations appears to be inevitable in small, obligately asexual populations, as these are incapable of reconstituting highly fit genotypes by recombination or back mutation. The cumulative buildup of such mutations is expected to lead to an eventual reduction in population size, and this facilitates the chance accumulation of future mutations. This synergistic interaction between population size reduction and mutation accumulation leads to an extinction process known as the mutational meltdown, and provides a powerful explanation for the rarity of obligate asexuality. We give an overview of the theory of the mutational meltdown, showing how the process depends on the demographic properties of a population, the properties of mutations, and the relationship between fitness and number of mutations incurred.},

  title={The relation of recombination to mutational advance},
  abstract={The method of calculation is shown wherebt a formula has been derived that approximately the ratio of the rate of accumulation of advantageous mutant genes in a population that undergoes recombination to the rate in an otherwise non-recombining one. A table is given showing the ratios thus found for different frequencies of advantageous mutations and different degrees of their advantage. It is shown that this calculation does not apply for mutant genes that act advantageously only when in some special combinations with one or more other mutant genes, and that as far as these cases of special synergism are concerned recombining lines have no evolutionary advantage over non-recombining ones. Other limitations of the formula are pointed out and {assessed.It} is explained that most factors that retard the rate of recombination—for expample, linkage, rarity of outbreeding, intercalation of sexual reproduction between more frequent cycles of sexual propagation, and partial isolation between subpopulations—must usually cause little long-term retardation of the speed of advance that is fostered by recombination. Moreover, even where long-term evolutions has virtually ceased, recombination of mutant genes still confers upon a population the means of adopting short-term genetic “dodges”, that adjust it to ecological and “physical” changes in its circumstances, much more rapidly than would be possible for a comparable asexual {population.Under} conditions where only stability of type is needed, a non-recombining does not actually degenerate as a result of an excess of mutation over selection, after the usual equilibrium between these pressures is reached. However, a irreversible ratchet mechanism exists in the non-recombining species (unlike the recombining ones) that prevents selection, even if intensified, from reducing the mutational loads below the lightest that were in existence when the intensified selection started, whereas, contrariwise, “drift”, and what might be called “selective noise” must allow occasional slips of the lightest loads in the direction of increased weight.},
